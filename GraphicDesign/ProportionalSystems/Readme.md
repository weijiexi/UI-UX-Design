## Mathematical Ratios and Proportional Systems
- Artists, architects, and musicians have been interested in ideal proportions. 
- Some looked to math for a system of creating ideal proportions that could be applied to the visual arts, music, and architecture.
- Most designers prefer to rely on their learned and innate sense
of proportion. 
- Others employ graphic devices that can aid in establishing harmony, such as Fibonacci numbers or the golden section, among other proportional systems.
