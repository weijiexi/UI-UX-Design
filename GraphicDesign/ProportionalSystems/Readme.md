# Proportional Systems and the Grid
## Mathematical Ratios and Proportional Systems
- Artists, architects, and musicians have been interested in ideal proportions. 
- Some looked to math for a system of creating ideal proportions that could be applied to the visual arts, music, and architecture.
- Most designers prefer to rely on their learned and innate sense
of proportion. 
- Others employ graphic devices that can aid in establishing harmony, such as Fibonacci numbers or the golden section, among other proportional systems.
- ### Proportion
    Proportion is the comparative size relationships of parts to
    one another and to the whole. Elements or parts are compared
    to the whole in terms of magnitude, measure, and/or quantity.

    For designers, it is an aesthetic arrangement—a harmonious or
    agreeable relationship of parts or elements within a whole. Considered proportions are one main key to creating pleasing
    form.

    In design, harmony is agreement within a composition, where elements are constructed, arranged, and function in relation to one another to a congruent effect. Art critic John

    Ruskin said, “In all perfectly beautiful objects there is found the opposition of one part to another and a reciprocal balance.” Although Ruskin’s view bestows value on aesthetics and beauty, a designer can deliberately play with expected proportion in a composition with the goal of creating graphic impact that is not even remotely about beauty, yet still establish a balanced reciprocity among the graphic elements.
- ### Fibonacci Numbers
    The opposite corners of the squares yields a spiral that resembles many found in plants, seashells, and other forms in nature.

- ### The Golden Ratio
    In Western art, shapes or structures defined by or based on the
    golden section have been considered aesthetically pleasing by
    many artists, designers, and architects. For example, architect
    Le Corbusier used the golden ratio as the basis of his modular architectural system. The golden ratio is still used today in graphic design, fine art, and architecture. Graphic designers utilize the golden section for grid systems and page formats.

- ### Rule of Thirds

    The rule of thirds is an asymmetrical compositional technique
    often used by painters, photographers, and designers to create visual interest and balance. It involves overlaying the format with a grid and positioning or aligning the focal point or primary graphic elements of the composition along these grid lines or especially on the intersections of the grid lines. To employ the rule, the focal point is placed at one intersection.
