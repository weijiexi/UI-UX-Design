### Type Selection
Before you choose a typeface, ```clearly define the audience, tone, personality and attitude``` of what you are trying to communicate and how you want to say it. 
#### Tips on Selecting a Typeface
- Select based on appropriateness for audience, design concept, message, communication requirements, and context.
- For large amounts of text, you need a highly readable typeface.
- select a typeface based on suitability for the purpose: editorial versus promotional versus branding.
- Notice the x-height of a typeface. A substantial or large x-height aids readability, especially on screen.

    - See if the typeface is versatile.
    - Read reviews of the typeface and font.
