# Typography
### Type Measurement
For the screen, you can specify type measurement using
points, pixels, percentages, or em units, which is a unit of mea-
surement in typography. An em is defined as the width of the
uppercase M in the parent face and point size; for example,
in 14-point type, an em is a distance of 14 points.
