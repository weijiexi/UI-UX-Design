### ❤️💚 2. **Emotional Duality**
- **Red**: Passion, love, energy, danger, power
- **Green**: Nature, calm, growth, balance, freshness

- Widely used in editorial design, branding, and Swiss-style layouts.

#### 4. **Visual Hierarchy via Value**

### When to Use Monochrome in Design

### Tools & Examples
- In Figma: Create grayscale or tonal palettes to test layouts.
