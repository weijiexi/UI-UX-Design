# Composition
## Fundamentals of Composition
- Creating visual interest and clarity of communication are two main goals of composition. 
- A formulaic design might be clear, but if it’s boring, no one is going to bother to look at it or spend time with it. Often, viewers will spend
more time trying to make sense of a message if the form of
a graphic design solution interests them. To create interest-
ing and comprehensible solutions, you need to develop keen compositional skills.
- Composition is the form, the whole spatial property and structure
resulting from the visualization and arrangement of graphic
elements—type and images—in relation to one another and
to the format, created with the intention to visually commu-
nicate, to be compelling, and to be expressive. 
- Composing is about how all the parts of your design work together — ```the visual organization of type and images in a graphic spatial arrangement.```
### The Format: Static Versus Active Composition
- Generally, compositions with dominating parallel movements are deemed more placid. 
- Compositionn with counterpointing movements are more active or tense;
### Responding to the Edges of the Format
All visual elements must respond to (though not necessar-
ily touch) the edges of the page. Not merely the end of the graphic space, a format’s boundaries fully participate in the
compositional structure.
### The Format: Closed Versus Open Composition
- The terms closed and open refer to the way the graphic elements of a composition relate to the edges of a format. 
### Symmetrical Versus Asymmetrical Compositions
- Whether in print or on screen, each static, single format has a vertical axis. Imagine a line down the center of the format. The equal distribution of visual weight on either side of the vertical axis is the key to establishing balance
### Illusion of Spatial Depth
- A plane is a flat surface, and the picture plane is the blank,
flat surface plane of a print or digital single, static page. When
you set out to compose on a two-dimensional surface, like a
screen or a piece of paper, you begin with the picture plane.

- As soon as you make one mark (draw a line, place a letterform,
or any graphic element) on the surface, that mark interacts
with the picture plane and perimeter of the format. The marks
you make and composition you create can maintain the flat
picture plane or can create the illusion of spatial depth.
