# Graphic Design: Formal Elements & Principles of Design
## Formal Elements   
- Line                  
- Shape
- Color
- Texture
### Line
- The basic functions of lines include: ```Define shapes, edges, forms; create images, letters, and patterns```
- Delineate boundaries and define areas within a composition
- Assist in ```visually organizing a composition and creating a line of vision``` 
- Can establish a linear mode of expression, a linear style
- When line is the predominant element used to unify a composition or to describe shapes or forms in a design (or painting), the style is termed ```linear```.

### Shape
- A ```curvilinear shape```, organic, or biomorphic shape is formed by curves or dominating marked flowing edges,which seems to have a naturalistic feel. It may be drawn precisely or loosely.
- An ```abstract shape``` refers to a simple or complex rearrangement, alteration, or distortion of the representation of natural appearance used for stylistic distinction and/or communication purposes.
- A ```representational shape``` is recognizable and reminds the viewer of actual objects seen in nature; it is also called a figurative shape.
- Figure(positive space)/Ground(negative space) - The figure or positive shape is a definite shape, immediately discernible as a shape.

### Tecture
- The tactile quality of a surface or the simulation or representation of such a surface quality is a texture. 
- In the visual arts, there are two categories of texture: tactile and visual.
- ```Tactile textures``` have actual tactile quality and can be physically
touched and felt; they are also called actual textures. 
- ```Visual textures``` are illusions of real textures created by hand,
scanned from actual textures, or photographed. Using skills learned in drawing, painting, photography, and various other image-making media, a designer can create a great variety of textures.
