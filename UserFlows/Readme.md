# User Flows
A user flow shows the steps a user takes to achieve a goal. Sketching these flows is intended to communicate the steps the user takes through different screens and actions. They should include a name, step number, and type of user for each flow.

As with your initial sketches, user flows don’t need to be pixel perfect or contain a lot of detail. In fact the simpler the better! You only need to show the steps you think users will take to complete their task with minimal visuals. It’s better to quickly construct flows that you can communicate with your team rather than spend a lot of time developing visuals that may not be technically feasible or impactful to the user experience.
User flows go in one direction, from the start of the task to its completion. They don't go backwards, that is prototyping. Name each flow and label each screen descriptively based on its purpose.
