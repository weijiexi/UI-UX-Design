## The Basics of Figma
- Toolbar
    - Scale tool - Using the scale tool can streamline your design process and ensure that your components maintain their visual balance as you adjust their size
    - Frames tool - Frames are essentially containers that act as the building blocks for your layouts. They can function like artboards or components, grouping elements together.
    - Section tool - Sections are used primarily for organizing and structuring your Figma files, especially when working on large projects. They act as visual dividers or containers that group multiple frames or elements.
    - Slice tool - The slice tool in Figma lets you define specific areas of your design for export without affecting the overall layout. It’s particularly useful when you need to extract assets or parts of a design that aren’t neatly contained in a frame or group.
