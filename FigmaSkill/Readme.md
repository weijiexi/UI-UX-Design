## The Basics of Figma

    - Scale tool - Using the scale tool can streamline your design process and ensure that your components maintain their visual balance as you adjust their size
    - Frames tool - Frames are essentially containers that act as the building blocks for your layouts. They can function like artboards or components, grouping elements together.
    - Section tool - Sections are used primarily for organizing and structuring your Figma files, especially when working on large projects. They act as visual dividers or containers that group multiple frames or elements.
