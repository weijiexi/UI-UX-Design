  Color can convey a mood, describe reality, or codify information. 
  Words like “gloomy,” “drab,” and “glittering” each bring to mind a general climate of colors, a palette of relationships.

  Designers use color to make some things stand out (warning signs) and to make other things disappear (camouflage). 
  Color serves to differentiate and connect, to highlight and to hide.
