颜色的无障碍
数字产品设计中的无障碍是为所有人打造体验的实践，包括我们这些有视觉、言语、听觉、身体或认知障碍的人。作为设计师、开发人员和普通技术人员，我们有能力创建一个令我们引以为豪的网络：一个为所有人打造并可供所有人使用的包容性网络。

确保您的产品颜色可用
在产品生命周期的早期就考虑可访问性是最好的——它可以减少您为使产品可追溯而花费的时间和金钱。在选择产品的调色板时，颜色可访问性需要一些前期工作，但确保颜色可访问性将在以后带来好处。
在产品开发的初期考虑到网站的可访问性可以减少产品开发的周期和资金的
添加足够的对比度
为了满足W3C 的最低 AA 评级，背景与文本的对比度应至少为 4.5:1。因此，在设计按钮、卡片或导航元素等内容时，请务必检查颜色组合的对比度。
不要仅仅依赖颜色
您还可以通过确保不依赖颜色来传递关键系统信息来确保可访问性。因此，对于错误状态、成功状态或系统警告等内容，请务必包含能够清楚地指出正在发生的情况的消息或图标。
记录和社交色彩系统
最后，创建可访问的颜色系统的最重要的方面是让您的团队能够在需要时引用它，以便每个人都清楚正确的用法。这不仅可以减少混乱和流失，还可以确保可访问性始终是您团队的首要任务。根据我的经验，明确指出 UI 套件或设计系统中特定颜色组合的可访问性评级是最有效的，尤其是在使用工具（例如InVision Craft或InVision DSM）在整个团队中进行社交时。以下是如何记录背景与文本颜色组合以及每个组合的可访问性评级的示例。
