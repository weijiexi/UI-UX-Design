# UX Design

In UI/UX design, several tools are used to define and visualize the structure and interaction of a product. 
Here are the key differences between **User Flow**, **Sitemap**, **Wireframe**, **Mockup**, and **Prototype**:

### 1. User Flow
A user flow is a visual representation of the path a user takes to complete a specific task within a product (e.g., sign up, purchase, or submit a form).
- Focuses on user behavior and decision points.
- Helps designers and developers understand how users navigate through the interface.
- Example: Login → Dashboard → Settings → Logout

### 2. Sitemap
A sitemap outlines the structure of a website or app, showing the hierarchy of pages.
- Helps define the information architecture.
- Useful for planning navigation and content organization.
- Example:
```
Home
├── About
├── Services
│   ├── Web Design
│   └── App Development
└── Contact
```
### 3. Wireframe
A wireframe is a low-fidelity sketch or layout of a page that shows structure and basic elements without design styling.
- Focuses on layout and content placement.
- Often grayscale and free of branding or images.
- Tools: Figma, Balsamiq, Adobe XD

### 4. Mockup
A mockup is a high-fidelity static representation of the design, including visual elements like colors, typography, and branding.
- Shows what the final design will look like.
- Great for client approvals and presentations.
- Tools: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD

### 5. Prototype
A prototype is an interactive, clickable version of the design, simulating the user experience and flow between screens.
- Used for usability testing.
- Demonstrates transitions and interactions.
- Types:
    - Low-fidelity (basic interactions)
    - High-fidelity (realistic interactions)
- Tools: Figma, InVision, Framer, Adobe XD
