#  Module 5: Designing Social AIs: Chatbots
we will explore AI chatbots that mimic human behavior, and how they have become social actors in relation to human beings. In this context, it is essential to understand what makes chatbots effective, why they evoke human-like responses, and how to manage the changing landscape of AI-human interaction. Let’s dive into what works, what doesn’t, and how to create more engaging and responsible AI experiences.
- Articulate the design space of social chatbots
- Explain how and why our human psychological hardware causes us to react to AI chatbots as if they were other humans
- Understand the risks of AI-generated content that is nearly indistinguishable from humans

  ### **The Architecture Behind Social Chatbots**
  At a high level, if these models generate open-ended responses dynamically rather than from a pre-written script, **it is typically a large language model behind the scenes, fine-tuned on human feedback**.
  - Generative Agents
  - AI Influencers and Performers
  - Customer Support Bots

  ### **Dialogue trees** 
  Dialogue trees function like **flowcharts** that map out potential conversation paths (resembling the branches of a tree). Each tree is composed of nodes that represent questions, responses, or actions. Each node represents decisions or user input, leading to branches that determine how the bot will respond.
  - Health Support Bots
  - Pick Your Metaphor Carefully
