# Wrap-up Webinar with Porf. Michael Bernstein

## 1. The “Spork Problem” in AI Design

- Definition: When a single general-purpose UI (like a text box) tries to do too much—like a spork being both a spoon and fork—it ends up doing everything poorly.
- Implication: AI tools often present a chat interface that’s too generic, leading to unclear affordances for specific tasks.
- Takeaway: Designers need to move beyond chatbot-style UIs by building task-specific interfaces that provide clarity and utility tailored to the use case.

### **What It Is:**
- The “Spork Problem” refers to the flawed design strategy of trying to cram many general-purpose AI functions into a single interface—typically a chat box—resulting in poor UX for all use cases.
- Like a spork (which tries to be a spoon and a fork but excels at neither), a generic AI chat interface is not optimized for any one task, making it less useful and harder to control.

### **Why It Matters:**
- Many AI products mimic ChatGPT’s UI, simply embedding a text box and calling it an “AI feature.” But users don't always want to talk; they want to do—so blindly copying ChatGPT's interaction style fails to serve specific user goals.
- Worse, this leads to what Bernstein calls the "ChatGPT gravity well": If your AI product feels too much like ChatGPT but isn't as powerful, users will abandon your product and just go to ChatGPT.

### **Design Recommendation:**
- Instead of defaulting to chat interfaces, designers should:
- Use LLMs behind the scenes for insight generation.
- Design task-specific, visual, and interactive interfaces.
- Offer clear affordances for actions, decisions, or creative workflows.
- Embed AI in context-aware UX, not just as a text input field.

### **Your Follow-Up Example (Audience Builder & Bamer)**
### **What You're Doing Right:**
- You described “Audience Builder”, which:
- Combines LLMs with internal data, social team input, and metrics, producing more relevant outputs.
- Wraps the AI capability in a visual interface tailored to media planners, not just a text box.
- You also cited Bamer’s new AI UX tool, which:
- Uses LLM search but restricts outputs to its vetted research database.
- Provides structured, trustworthy, and scoped insights rather than open-ended responses.

### **Key Insight:**
- Your approach reflects Bernstein’s suggestion to differentiate by embedding LLMs within workflows that are tied to user context and goals.
- You’re already moving beyond the spork — building hybrid, domain-specific, multimodal UIs rather than relying solely on language.

### **Takeaway for Designers**
- To avoid falling into the “spork problem,” AI UX designers should:
- Avoid over-generalization. One chat box ≠ one-size-fits-all.
- Design AI-native UI controls (e.g., sliders, toggles, visual filters, charts, previews).
- Leverage language models, but disguise them in tools, not just talk.
- Tie AI outputs to owned data or team workflows to boost trust and context relevance.
- Differentiate from ChatGPT or risk becoming redundant

## 2. The Grounding Problem
Definition: The challenge of LLMs “understanding” what the user actually means without clarifying questions or context negotiation.

Problem: Models often “steamroll ahead” with assumptions instead of asking for clarification (e.g., ChatGPT gives you a powder room even if you didn’t ask for one).

Solution Path: Train or prompt LLMs to selectively ask smart follow-up questions. Overdoing it (e.g., mandatory Q&A mode) can feel clunky. Balance is key.

Relevance: Essential for improving user experience, especially in creative tools, AI co-design systems, and decision-making apps.

## 3. Moving Beyond the Chatbot Interface
Current State: Many AI tools copy ChatGPT’s general interface.

Concern: If your product looks and behaves like ChatGPT but offers less flexibility, users will just go back to ChatGPT.

Design Goal: Create unique UX affordances, visual interfaces, or embedded workflows that add value beyond a text box.

## 4. Simulated Users and Generative Agents
Use Case: Stanford’s work with generative agents (e.g., in Smallville) shows how agents with memory, planning, and reflection can simulate believable human behavior.

Update: These agents can now be built using real UX interview data, not just demographics, resulting in up to 85% accuracy in mimicking user survey responses.

Application: Can be used for rapid UX feedback, design testing, and anticipating second-order effects before launching a feature.

Your Opportunity: This aligns closely with MuseMind's vision of reflective, co-creative agents.

## 5. The Overpromise of Fully Autonomous Agents
Hot Trend: Many startups are chasing the dream of fully autonomous AI agents.

Bernstein's View: Skeptical for now — the models aren’t good enough for high-stakes autonomy.

Safer Bet: Human-in-the-loop systems and tight feedback cycles are more viable in the near term.

## 6. Real-World Use Cases from Participants
Tools like Lovable and Bolt: Used for rapid design exploration, prototyping, and idea generation, especially by PMs without design support.

Dentsu’s Eye-Tracking AI Tool: Scans Figma layouts and suggests changes to boost conversions based on heatmaps and attention data.

Limitations: Many tools are still better for ideation and buy-in than pixel-perfect production design or dev handoff.

### Final Thoughts
We're in the “MySpace era” of AI design—lots of experimentation, but no clear patterns or best practices yet.

Designers must lead with specificity, differentiating their products with tailored UIs, contextual understanding, and user trust as foundational goals.
