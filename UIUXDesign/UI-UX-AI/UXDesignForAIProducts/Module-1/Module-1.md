## Module 1: Centering the Human in Human-AI Interaction

- **Algorithm aversion**: The tendency of people to distrust or reject algorithms, especially when they see them making mistakes or when they feel that their own judgment is being undermined by automated systems.  
- **Gesture Input**: Form of human-computer interaction where users can control or interact with a device using physical movements, typically recognized and interpreted by sensors and artificial intelligence.  
- **Intelligence Augmentation**: Intelligence augmentation (IA) refers to the use of artificial intelligence to enhance human knowledge and capabilities.  
- **Seam Between Humans and AI**: Refers to the interaction point where human users and artificial intelligence systems meet. It emphasizes the importance of seamless integration and effective communication between AI and humans for successful outcomes.

  <summary>People: Where AI Lives or Dies</summary>

  - Technical factors alone do not determine an AI application's success or failure. Success lies in whether **people find value in these applications**.
  - Createing robots that hook effectively into our psychology so that the human and AI, together, are effective. It’s not the AI alone that makes a design effective, and it’s not the design alone—it’s finding **a design that correctly frames the mental model** that the user ought to build, rather than forcing them **to think incredibly hard about what the AI is intending**.
  - Implementing AI into a design requires navigating the transition between automation and human control. Excellent artificial intelligence alone is not enough; the key to success lies in **how well the AI integrates with human users**.
  - The seam between the AI and the person, The seam is where the action is: **it's what causes the system to succeed or fail**.
  - **Mistakes are inevitable when a user interface implies capabilities that the underlying AI ultimately cannot deliver on**.
  - We need to remember the **importance of the seam between people and technology**. This is ultimately going to decide if a generative AI tool will be successful or not. **The seam between humans and artificial intelligence is one of our main focuses when it comes to researching AI-driven design**.

  <summary>Intelligence Augmentation</summary>

  - Intelligence augmentation (IA) is about **how we make ourselves better, smarter, and more effective with AI** — rather than seeking to have AI replace people.
  -  “By augmenting human intellect, **we mean increasing the capability of a [person] to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit [their] particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems**.” (Engelbart, 1962)
  - The point of IA is to augment human intelligence and empower us to make smarter decisions, not to just replace us with AIs.

  <summary>Achieving Intelligence Augmentation</summary>

  - What and who am I augmenting? It is advisable that you begin by analyzing where there might be keenly felt gaps in information, knowledge, or execution. What do your decision makers wish they knew? What knowledge or execution could make them better at what they’re trying to do? 

  | 1. How might [this group] react to [this message]? | 2. What is a concise summary of the project status? | 3. This situation is turning into a conflict. What might happen if I take this action? |

  - What's your goal? What are you trying to improve? Replacement has a clear goal: reduce the number of person-hours required to do work, thereby saving money.
  - they are not simply creating AI chatbots. Instead, they are attempting to answer foundational questions like "What is the human need?” and “How do I empower people to better address that need through AI?" If you can't answer these questions, your AI-powered design is doomed to fail.

> **Discussion Forum: AI Successes and Failures**
> - For this forum, please name an AI product you felt was a design success and an AI product you felt was a design failure. 
> - What went right and what went wrong in each case?

> **Assignment: Propose a Design Concept for an AI-Powered Interactive Product**
>
> Identify a specific human need or gap and imagine an AI product that can address it. Describe what the product would look like if it were designed to completely replace human effort, and explain why this design might be rejected or fail. Then, outline an alternative design focusing on intelligence augmentation, where the AI assists humans rather than replaces them, and explain why this augmented approach might succeed where the fully automated version could fail.
