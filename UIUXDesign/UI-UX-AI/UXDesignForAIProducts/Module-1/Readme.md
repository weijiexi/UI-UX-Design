## Module 1: Centering the Human in Human-AI Interaction

### Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Algorithm Aversion** | The tendency of people to distrust or reject algorithms, especially when they see them make mistakes or feel their judgment is undermined. |
| **Gesture Input** | A form of human-computer interaction using physical movements to control or interact with a device, interpreted by sensors and AI. |
| **Intelligence Augmentation (IA)** | The use of AI to enhance human knowledge and capabilities, not replace them. |
| **Seam Between Humans and AI** | The interaction point between humans and AI systems; success depends on how well they integrate and communicate. |

### People: Where AI Lives or Die
- The success of AI applications is **not purely technical**. It depends on **user value and experience**.
- AI must work **with** human psychology—not against it.
- Mistakes happen when interfaces **mislead users about what AI can do**.
- The **seam** between people and AI is where success or failure occurs.
- Good design means making AI's **mental model understandable** to users.

### Intelligence Augmentation

> “By augmenting human intellect, we mean increasing the capability of a [person] to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit [their] particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems.” — *Engelbart, 1962*

- IA enhances **human capabilities** rather than replacing them.
- The goal is to help people **make smarter decisions**, not reduce headcount.
- Ask key questions:
  - **What and who am I augmenting?**
  - **Where are the gaps in knowledge or execution?**
  - **What do decision-makers wish they knew?**

### Designing for IA: Sample Prompts to Support Users

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| How might [this group] react to [this message]? | Understand reactions and perceptions |
| What is a concise summary of the project status? | Enable clear reporting and comprehension |
| This situation is turning into a conflict. What might happen if I take this action? | Forecast consequences and guide decisions |

### AI Design Success = Empowering People
- Don't start by designing a chatbot — start by identifying:
  - **What is the human need?**
  - **How can AI empower users to meet that need?**

> If you can't answer these questions, your AI-powered design is **doomed to fail**.
