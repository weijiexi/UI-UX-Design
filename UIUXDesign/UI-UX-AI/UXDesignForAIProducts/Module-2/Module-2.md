## Module 2: Prototyping AI Designs

- **Prototyping** is the activity of creating rapid approxim Prototyping lies at the heart of innovation, involving the quick building of rough versions of ideas to gather internal and external feedback. This iterative process fuels creativity, collaboration, and design, bridging the gap between conceptualization and realization. Prototyping is fundamentally about rapidly approximating your ideas to facilitate iteration. 
- Beyond visualization, prototyping explores the design's functionality and target audience, fostering a deeper understanding to ensure the final product resonates with users.
- We will cover essential **traditional prototyping methods** and modern approaches widely used in **large language model prototypes** and **the use of ChatGPT**. We will also explore advanced techniques such as **Wizard of Oz prototyping** and **embedding AI in design**.

## Why Prototype? Understanding the Design Process
 
### human-centered design (HCD)
- Human-centered design (HCD) is a creative problem-solving approach that flips the script on traditional development. Instead of focusing solely on technical feasibility, human-centered design prioritizes the people we are designing for. This iterative process starts by understanding their needs and behaviors, and then uses those insights to craft tailor-made solutions.
- The core of human-centered design lies in empathy. By observing users and gathering feedback throughout the process (understanding, ideation, prototyping, testing), designers continuously refine their solutions. This ensures the final product is not only intuitive and accessible but also resonates with the target audience's wants and pain points.
- Ultimately, human-centered design leads to products that users feel invested in, because they have been part of the journey. This translates into higher user satisfaction and potentially, greater profitability.

### the challenges in AI-based product design
- ntegrating AI into human-centered design introduces new challenges, especially in understanding AI capabilities during need-finding, ideation, and prototyping. Traditional methods often fall short for AI systems, requiring innovative strategies for effective evaluation. AI has the potential to revolutionize product development by enhancing user experiences and driving business growth, but it demands a deep understanding of technologies, substantial resources, and skilled teams.
- For example, integrating AI into an e-commerce platform to analyze customer behavior and offer personalized recommendations involves training algorithms on vast data, optimizing infrastructure, and ensuring seamless integration. This process can disrupt workflows, so it requires careful planning and team training. Close collaboration between developers, AI experts, and stakeholders is essential.
- While AI integration in product development poses challenges, adopting the right strategies allows businesses to unlock AI's full potential, by ultimately creating products that meet consumer needs and drive growth.

By creating tangible representations, teams can rigorously test assumptions, refine designs, and ensure that the final product aligns with user needs. It saves time and resources while sparking innovation through experimentation.

In AI development, for example, prototyping can uncover challenges early, allowing for course corrections before full-scale production.

## Why Prototyping is Particularly Challenging for AI-Based Designs

When undertaking human-centered design or incorporating AI-based elements, we often follow a structured process. One widely recognized framework comes from the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University, also known as d.school. As illustrated in the provided graph, the framework has six crucial steps:

![prototyping](./prototyping.jpg "prototyping")
- **Understand**: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the problem space
- **Observe**: Conduct thorough observations to gather insights about the users and their needs
- **Point of View**: Formulate a unique perspective on the problem, which serves as an angle to approach the solution
- **Ideate**: Generate a wide range of ideas and concepts that could potentially solve the problem
- **Prototype**: Create tangible representations of the ideas to test their viability
- **Test**: Evaluate the prototypes with real users to gather feedback and refine the solution

**prototyping is the most problematic stage in the context of AI**
- Traditionally, you can get feedback on a prototype just by creating static mocks of the system. 
- with AI, **we need to prototype the AI's behavior**. 
- Prototyping AI systems requires a different approach. The complexity of developing functional AI prototypes, which **involve sophisticated algorithms and data processing**, significantly increases the difficulty of this step. As such, effective prototyping in AI requires adapting traditional methods to accommodate these unique challenges.
- AI tools can exhibit unexpected behavior because they are designed to respond to open-ended inputs, and in the case of generative AI, to produce open-ended responses as well. Consequently, AI tools require more comprehensive testing strategies to mock in their complexity and potential unpredictability. 
- AI systems learn and adapt from data, which introduces a level of variability that can lead to unforeseen outcomes.
- Prototyping allows developers to simulate AI functionality to provide preliminary insights into the system's performance and the user experience and 

AI projects typically unfold in two major phases: **product vision** and **model development**

- **Product vision**: In the product vision phase, prototypes help answer fundamental questions about what product to make and how humans should interact with the AI. Although prototypes do not directly provide these answers, they help test hypotheses by offering a cheaper alternative to building the full product. This allows the development team to explore multiple options and gather feedback from stakeholders and users about the potential of each. Prototyping in this phase is crucial for aligning the product with user needs and expectations.
- **Model development**: The model development phase focuses on the detailed workings of the AI system itself. Here, prototypes are used to determine the specific functionalities the system should have and to identify the areas where AI is needed versus where heuristics or human intervention might be more effective. This phase is more granular, involving the testing of specific components and interactions within the model. Prototypes in this phase help developers pinpoint the key areas that require AI's capabilities, ensuring that the final system is both efficient and effective.
- **Value prototypes**: Value prototypes aim to identify the potential value and feasibility of AI functionalities. During the product vision phase, they assess the overall potential of the product and gather feedback from users and stakeholders. In the model development phase, value prototypes help determine where AI should be applied versus where simpler solutions might suffice.
- **Interaction prototypes**: Interaction prototypes focus on understanding how users interact with AI. In the product vision phase, they explore different ways users might provide inputs and interact with the system, helping developers refine the design. During the model development phase, interaction prototypes ensure that the design is practical and grounded, avoiding overly ambitious expectations that the AI might not be able to meet.

It serves as a crucial activity that fosters innovation, collaboration, creativity, and design. As we test our prototype, we can reflect on its performanceâ€”recognizing **what works well and what does not**. It is important to remember that the true goal of prototyping is not the prototype itself, but **the feedback and insights we gain throughout the process**.

**when it comes to AI-powered designs, prototyping can become more complex**

## Two essential techniques for prototyping AI-powered systems
- Experience prototype: you're trying to prototype how it feels to use the system.
- Technical prototype: you're trying to prototype whether it's possible to build the system.
