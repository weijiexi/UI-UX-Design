# Module 2: Prototyping AI Designs

## Overview
Prototyping AI designs is essential for transforming abstract ideas into tangible solutions. This process involves simulating or building simplified versions of AI products to collect feedback, test user experience, and validate assumptions. Module 2 explores how prototyping is uniquely challenging in AI design due to unpredictable model behavior, open-ended inputs, and user expectations.

## 1. Human-Centered Design and AI
- **Human-Centered Design (HCD)** prioritizes empathy and user needs over technical feasibility.
- The design process involves: understanding, observing, defining the point of view, ideating, prototyping, and testing.
- In AI, this process must adapt to the unpredictability of intelligent systems and require more cross-functional collaboration.
- Challenges include training data, infrastructure, and aligning AI outcomes with user expectations.

## 2. Prototyping AI-Powered Systems
- Traditional static mockups aren’t enough; AI prototypes must simulate real behavior.
- AI systems are tested across two phases:
  - **Product Vision Phase**: Exploratory prototypes answer what the AI should do and how users should interact with it.
  - **Model Development Phase**: Focused prototypes test technical feasibility and fine-tune model behaviors.
- **Value prototypes** assess AI’s usefulness and business viability.
- **Interaction prototypes** explore user interaction and system response flow.
- AI's unpredictability requires designing around edge cases, errors, and user trust.

## 3. Prototyping Techniques for AI
> #### Experience Prototypes
> - Focus on how it *feels* to use the system.
> - Example: Using ChatGPT to simulate a conversation instead of building a chatbot interface.

> #### Technical Prototypes
> - Focus on whether the system can technically function.
> - Use large language models (LLMs) to quickly test feasibility before building a full product.

### LLM Prototyping Approach:
1. Define the problem clearly.
2. Prototype a simplified interaction using text-based models.
3. Use tools like ChatGPT or APIs for quick testing.
4. Iterate based on feedback.
5. Share findings with stakeholders for validation.

### Wizard of Oz Prototyping
- A method where a human mimics the AI's role behind the scenes.
- Allows testing ideas and collecting feedback before technical implementation.
- Requires planning, user interaction flows, and team coordination.
- Pros: Fast, cost-effective, user-focused.
- Cons: Labor-intensive and can break immersion if not executed smoothly.

## Conclusion
Prototyping AI is a powerful practice that merges technical validation with human-centered design. It helps teams de-risk AI development, validate user experience, and refine design direction before investing heavily in engineering.
