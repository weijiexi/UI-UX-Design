  <summary>Capstone Project Part 1: Problem Identification and Research (Related to Modules 1 and 2)</summary>

#### Instructions:
- After completing modules 1 and 2 of the course, research a need or gap in the market that could be addressed through an AI-powered design.
- For this, you will first conduct between 2–5 interviews to analyze user pain points.
- Think of how these might be solved using principles mentioned in Module 2, such as intelligence augmentation. 
- You can use these sample interview questions as a starting point, but feel free to tailor them or ask additional questions that better suit your specific case.

  <summary>Capstone Project Part 2: Concept Development and User Interaction</summary>

#### Instructions:
- After completing modules 3 and 4 of the course, develop a conceptual design for an AI-powered product that addresses the identified need, based on your findings from your first capstone project submission.
- Analyze how you might balance user control and automation and create a basic low-fidelity prototype (such as a wireframe or sketch) illustrating the user interaction with the AI system.
- Address how the product would foster user trust and avoid algorithm aversion or overreliance. 
- Make sure to integrate any feedback provided by your learning facilitator on part one of the capstone project.

  <summary>Capstone Project Part 3: Ethics and Societal Impact Review</summary>

### Instructions:
- As a final submission for your capstone project, you will conduct an ethics and societal impact review of the AI-powered product you have proposed and prototyped.
- This review should assess potential ethical risks (e.g., bias, privacy) and societal impacts, and propose strategies to mitigate them. 
- Make sure to integrate any feedback provided by your learning facilitator on parts one and two of the capstone project. 

### **Ethics and Society Review of “I am OK,thanks”**
- Privacy and Ethical Risks
- Societal Impact
- Bias and Algorithmic Fairness
- Long-Term Ethical Considerations
- Users without smartphones
- Users without friends and family members
### **Conclusion**
