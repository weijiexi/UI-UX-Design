**Objectives**:
- Analyze the core tension between complete user control and introducing tools that enhance automation while also increasing the risk for error
- Describe design patterns that are used to manage the user control versus automation tradeoff
- Identify successful and failed examples at managing the trade-off between user control and automation, such as Clippy, Google Maps, Google Docs, and Gmail

### Module 4: User Trust and Explainability
- What is trust in AI systems? Why does it matter?
- The goal: complementarity
- Why do we not achieve complementarity right now?
- Can explainable AI help?

**Objectives**:
- Articulate why user trust is critical to successful human-AI interaction
- Understand the psychological principles driving user under- and over-trust in AI systems
- Explain algorithm aversion and its implications for designing systems that might err

## Does the Stanford UI/UX Design for AI Products Course Cover UI Design?

If you're coming from a visual design or UI design background, it's important to understand how much this course focuses on **UX vs. UI**, and whether it’s still valuable for you.


## Focus of the Course: UX-Centered

The course is titled **UI/UX Design for AI Products**, but the **main emphasis is on UX strategy and interaction design**, particularly:
- Human-AI interaction
- Designing for trust, explainability, and user control
- Prototyping AI behavior and ethical decision-making


## What About UI Design?

The course **does not focus heavily on visual UI design**, such as:
- Typography, layout, or color theory
- UI kits, design systems (like Material Design), or visual aesthetics
- Visual prototyping in high fidelity (e.g., Figma UI polish)

However, UI designers still benefit by learning:
- How to **design flows for AI-powered products**
- How to **prototype and test intelligent interactions**
- How to **collaborate with UX researchers and AI engineers**
- How to **create meaningful UI for intelligent systems** (e.g. dashboards, chatbots, recommendations)


## Ideal for UI Designers If You Want To:

| Goal                                        | Course Value                        |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Transition from UI to UX in AI context      | ✅ Excellent fit                    |
| Learn strategy behind intelligent systems   | ✅ Highly relevant                  |
| Learn design systems or UI polish           | ❌ Not the focus                    |
| Get visual feedback on interface aesthetics | ❌ Minimal visual design critique   |


## Summary

| You Are...                | You Will Learn...                                         |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| A UI designer             | How to design AI-driven *interactions*, not just visuals   |
| Strong in visual skills   | New UX skills like trust design, prototyping, and feedback |
| Wanting visual polish     | Complement with a UI-focused course like Refactoring UI    |


## Pro Tip:

To get the most out of the course as a UI designer:
- Treat it as a **strategic UX upgrade**, not a UI polish course
- Use your visual skills to **elevate your AI product prototypes**
- Pair it with UI design tutorials if you want both UX + UI polish

> Think of this course as helping you design **how AI should behave**, not just how it should look.
