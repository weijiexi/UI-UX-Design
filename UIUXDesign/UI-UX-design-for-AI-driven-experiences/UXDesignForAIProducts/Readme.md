#### Project 3: Wizard of Oz AI Prototype
**Goal:** Simulate an AI feature (e.g. recommendation, summarization) manually  
- Include paper/Figma/Miro prototypes  
- Explain how you tested reactions and collected feedback  
- Optional: Use ChatGPT or Uizard to support prototyping

#### Project 4: Brand Visual Identity for an AI Product
**Goal:** Create a visual system for an AI-based service  
- Logo, colors, typography
