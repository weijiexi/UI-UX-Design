  <summary>Portfolio Planning: Brand Visual & UI/UX Design with AI Integration</summary>

This guide is for creatives transitioning into UI/UX design with a focus on **AI-driven products**. It outlines how to plan a portfolio that blends **brand visuals**, **interface design**, and **AI-integrated experiences** — inspired by the structure and topics of Stanford’s *UI/UX Design for AI Products* course.

### Portfolio Objectives
- Show your evolution from **visual design to interaction design**
- Demonstrate understanding of **AI-powered product experiences**
- Highlight **ethical, human-centered, and intuitive UX**
- Integrate modern workflows including **script-based design** and **Figma Dev Mode + MCP**

### Suggested Portfolio Structure

**1. About Me / Bio**
- Visual design + fine arts background
- Transition story into AI-integrated UX
- Emphasize systems thinking, empathy, and creativity
- Describe your familiarity with tools like **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Figma Dev Mode**, and **script-based workflows**

**2. Core Projects (3–5 Case Studies)**

#### Project 1: Human-AI Interaction Redesign
**Goal:** Redesign a common app (e.g. calendar, email) with an AI assistant  
- Sketch automation vs. control flows  
- Show UI states that explain *why* the AI made decisions  
- Bonus: Add animations to show transitions or AI reactions
- **Script-based element:** Use Tailwind + Framer Motion to show transitions

#### Project 2: Social Chatbot Interface
**Goal:** Design a chatbot that feels natural, emotional, or brand-aligned  
- Chat interface layout and tone  
- Trust design: How to show limits, fallback options  
- Ethics: What boundaries are in place for transparency?
- **MCP integration:** Use model context maps to define limits and fallback logic

#### Project 3: Wizard of Oz AI Prototype
**Goal:** Simulate an AI feature (e.g. recommendation, summarization) manually  
- Include paper/Figma/Miro prototypes  
- Explain how you tested reactions and collected feedback  
- Optional: Use ChatGPT or Uizard to support prototyping

#### Project 4: Brand Visual Identity for an AI Product
**Goal:** Create a visual system for an AI-based service  
- Logo, colors, typography  
- Interface snippets and microinteractions  
- Style guide inspired by AI’s function (e.g. calm AI for wellness, vibrant AI for creativity)
- **Script-based enhancement:** Build the interface using React + Tailwind  
- **Figma Dev Mode:** Extract variables and design tokens for consistent dev handoff

#### Project 5: AI Dashboard or Data Insight Tool
**Goal:** Design an interface for visualizing AI-generated insights  
- Cards, filters, graphs, or generative text previews  
- Explain tradeoffs in information density and user control  
- Reflect on trust and error handling
- **Advanced add-on:** Integrate Three.js or D3.js for data visualization

### Tools You Can Use
| Type            | Tools                                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| UI & prototyping | Figma, Uizard, Miro, Webflow, Wix Studio, Figma Dev Mode   |
| AI prototyping   | ChatGPT, Galileo AI, Pika.art, Khroma, Locofy              |
| Motion & coding  | P5.js, Three.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion     |
| Script-based build | Vite, pnpm, Git, deploy tools (Netlify/Vercel)            |
| Dev handoff      | Figma Dev Mode, MCP model-to-code thinking                 |
| Documentation    | Notion, Markdown, PDF storytelling                         |

### Tips
- Clearly explain: Problem & context  
- Show: AI integration concept  
- Describe: Design process (sketches, tests, feedback)  
- Display: Final UI screens & reflections  
- Emphasize your **thinking** — not just visual polish  
- Include: Video walkthroughs or animated prototypes if possible  
- **Highlight how script-based workflows and Figma Dev Mode helped save time or ensure design/code alignment**

### Final Notes

This portfolio will:
- Show hiring teams your visual taste + system thinking  
- Demonstrate real-world awareness of AI use cases  
- Prepare you for UX roles in AI tools, startups, or ethical design teams  
- Show you can balance **design excellence** with **efficient development workflows** using code and design systems
