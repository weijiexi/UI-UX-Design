## Module 0: Quick Primer on AI and Design

## What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
**Definition**: AI is a subfield of computer science focused on improving automated performance on tasks that require cognition.  
**Core Principle**: AI maps **input ➝ output**. Understanding both clearly is essential for effective AI use.

### Key AI Concepts and Fields

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Machine Learning (ML)** | A field of AI that uses large datasets to train models instead of relying on explicit programming. |
| **Deep Learning** | A subset of ML using layered networks (nodes) to learn patterns and make predictions from large inputs. |
| **Large Language Models (LLMs)** | Pre-trained AI models (e.g., ChatGPT) that process and generate human-like language based on prompts. |
| **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | AI’s ability to understand and generate human language. |
| **Computer Vision** | AI that interprets and understands visual information (images/videos). |
| **Generative AI** | Models that generate new content like text, images, or music in response to prompts. |
| **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** | The design and study of how people interact with digital systems. |

### How AI Works: From Input to Output
Most modern AI systems operate through a **prompt–response** pattern:

| Application | Input | Output |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| Photo editing | Image | Image without background |
| Blog tools | Blog post | Catchy headline |
| Translation | English phrase | French phrase |
| ChatGPT | User prompt | Text response |
| Netflix | Watch history | Movie/show recommendations |
| Stitch Fix | Liked/bought clothes | Clothing suggestions |
| Zillow | Property images | Predicted prices |
| Fraud detection | Financial behavior | Fraud alert |
| Medical app | Smartwatch sensor data | Glucose prediction |

### How Large Language Models Work
- **Pretraining**: Models learn language patterns by predicting the next word from huge text datasets.
- **Instruction Tuning**: Models are trained on example instructions + responses to follow user commands.
- **APIs**: Many LLMs are accessible via APIs or open-source versions (e.g., OpenAI, Meta).
- **Fine Tuning**: Customizing a model for a specific task by training it further on targeted examples.
- **Value Alignment**: Making sure the model behaves ethically and as intended.

| Product | AI Use | Input | Output |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Webex** | Meeting summaries | Audio | Summary text |
| **Microsoft Copilot** | Task automation | Text command | Written/actionable response |
| **Netflix** | Recommendations | Viewing history | Suggested content |
| **Zillow** | Price prediction | Property images | Estimated price |
| **Stitch Fix** | Clothing suggestions | Purchase history | Clothing options |
| **Fraud Detection** | Behavior analysis | Financial activity | Fraud alert |
| **Medical Wearables** | Health prediction | Sensor data | Glucose estimate |
