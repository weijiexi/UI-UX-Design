# Visualization
#### Visualization and composition, major components in the design process, are driven by a design concept and communication goals.

As Alice E. Drueding, Professor, Graphic and Interactive Design and Area Head of the BFA Program at Tyler School of Art, Temple University, points out, steps in the design process may not progress in an orderly fashion: “The order I emphasize with students is
- Concept
- General visualization (content, medium, style) 
- Organization (composition, grid, golden section, etc.)—with the caveat that things don’t always work in such a linear manner.”

  #### Graphic designers work with two main components: type and images. 
  - Type can be created in a variety of ways—computer generated, hand drawn, handmade, found, or photographed. 
  - Images is a broad term encompassing a great variety of representational, abstract, or nonobjective images—photographs, illustrations, drawings, paintings, prints, pictographs, signs, symbols, maps, diagrams, optical illusions, patterns, and graphic elements and marks; images are also called visuals.
  - Classifying images helps you understand the range and how to depict them to meet your communication goals.

    - Notation: a linear, reductive visual that captures the essence of its subject, characterized by its minimalism.
    - Pictograph: an elemental, universal picture denoting an object, activity, place, or person captured through shape—for example, the images denoting gender on restroom doors.
    - Silhouette: the articulated shape of an object or subject taking its specificity into account (as opposed to the more elemental form of a pictograph).
    - Linear: a shape or form described predominantly by use of line.
    - Contour: a shape or form depicted through the linear outline of an object’s or subject’s boundaries.
    - Light and Shadow: using light and shadow to describe form and the illusion of three-dimensional space. This most closely simulates how we perceive forms in nature. Also, a logical flow of light, as it touches and describes forms, can help unify a composition. An extreme use of light and shadow is called chiaroscuro (also called claire-obscure).
    - Naturalistic: a visual appearance or style created by full color or tone using light and shadow that attempts to replicate an object or subject as it is perceived in nature; also called realistic. (Please note, in modern and contemporary fine art theory and criticism, the terms naturalism and realism are defined differently and represent different
    schools of thought.)
    - Expressionistic: a style of visualization characterized by a highly stylized or subjective interpretation, with an emphasis on the psychological or spiritual meaning. There is no strict adherence to things as they appear in nature, as opposed to naturalism.

    There are three basic classifications of depiction as they directly refer to and then move away from what we see in nature:

    ![Classifying images](./ClassifyingImages-2.jpg "Classifying images")
    - Representational: a rendering that attempts to replicate actual objects as seen in nature. The viewer recognizes the image; also called pictorial or figurative.
    - Abstraction: a simple or complex rearrangement, alteration, or distortion of the representation of natural appearance, used for stylistic distinction and/or communication purposes.
    - Nonobjective: a purely invented visual that is not derived from anything visually perceived. It does not relate to any object in nature and does not literally represent a person, place, or thing; also called nonrepresentational.

  <summary>About Signs and Symbols</summary>

  Graphic design signifies. 
  Graphic design represents. 
  Graphic design communicates. 

  From the theory of semiotics, the study of signs and symbols, we have a classification of signs—what they mean and how they are used in graphic design.

  - Sign: a visual mark or a part of language that denotes
another thing. For example, the word dog and a pictograph
of a dog are both signs used to represent “dog”; the $ denotes
money; the written letter H is a sign for a spoken sound.
  - Icon: a visual (pictorial image or symbol) to represent
objects, actions, and concepts. An icon resembles the thing
it represents or, at a minimum, shares a quality with it. It
can be a photograph, a pictorial representation, an elemen-
tal visual (think magnifying glass desktop icon), arbitrary
(think radioactive sign), or symbolic (think lightning bolt
to represent electricity).
  - Index: a sign that signifies through a direct relationship
between the sign and the object, without describing or
resembling the thing signified. There are a variety of ways
this happens: whether as a cue that makes the viewer think
of the reference (for example, a pacifier is an indexical sign
for an infant), by its proximity to it (for example, a diver
down flag means someone is under water and you must
steer clear of the area), by actually pointing to the thing
signified (an arrow at an intersection on a roadside), or by
being physical evidence of it (for example, a photogram of
a hand or a hoof print on the ground).
  - Symbol: a visual that has an arbitrary or conventional
relationship between the signifier and the thing signi-
fied. We decode meaning through learned associations
(for example, a dove has become accepted as a symbol of
peace). Spoken or written words are symbols as well.
  - Some symbols take on greater meaning than most other
symbols due to their context and roles in religion, cul-
ture, history, or society. Examples include the cross in
Christianity, the phoenix for eternal life, the ankh for
life associated with ancient Egypt, the Star of David in
Judaism, and the yin–yang, which is the Chinese symbol of
the interplay of forces in the universe. It is hard to think of
antiwar protest posters without thinking of the nuclear dis-
armament symbol designed by Gerald Holton in 1956. This
graphic, a circle with a few lines in it, stands for something
as profound as the idea of peace.

   #### Signs and symbols—reductive images—serve many functions in graphic design. 

   - ```They can be stand-alone images``` such as a pictograph of a woman on a restroom door, a desktop or mobile icon, 
   - ```or components of a broader design solution``` such as a sign system that is part of a visual identity program. They serve as icons for mobile web and apps. Icons are also referred to as symbol signs.

   #### So much information must be universally understood crossing language and cultural barriers. 

   - Signs or icons in the form of pictographs—visual, nonverbal communication—are characterized by elemental forms. These graphics depict universal, immediately recognizable objects, places, human gestures, and actions, which are easily deciphered by all; they are also called pictograms.

   #### [ISOTYPE](http://www.gerdarntz.org/isotype.html)

   The International System Of Typographic Picture Education was developed in the twentieth-century by the Viennese social scientist and philosopher Otto Neurath as a method for visual statistics. Gerd Arntz was the designer tasked with making Isotype’s pictograms and visual signs. Arntz designed around 4000 such signs, which symbolized key data from industry, demographics, politics, and economy. The pictograms designed by Arntz were systematically employed in combination with stylized maps and diagrams. Neurath and Arntz made extensive collections of visual statistics in this manner, and their system became a world-wide emulated example of what we now term: infographics.

   Otto Neurath’s goals were to aid people by directly illustrat-
ing information about the world for those who were illiterate,
or could just barely read, as well as by designing information
that could be universally understood, overcoming barriers of
language and culture.

   - Information graphics in the form of icons are also used to
help people navigate spaces or life issues. Wayfinding systems,
used internationally, assist and guide visitors and tourists to find what they are looking for in museums, airports, zoos, and
city centers. The Talk Chart, a communication device, is an
example of information design . Using the 81
⁄2" 311" laminated pointing chart, people in healthcare facilities
who cannot speak due to stroke, aphasia, or other physical
challenges can now make their needs known to family and
staff by pointing to the graphic symbols or letters of the alpha-
bet that appear on the chart.

   - The primary objective of the Disability Access Symbols Project
is for organizations to use these to better serve their audiences with disabilities. The Graphic Artists Guild

   Foundation explains:
   “The project was extremely challenging in terms of design
because the client insisted on having organizations representing
people with various disabilities review and comment on the
proposed symbols. With the help of a disability consultant, we
were able to reach consensus among all these groups and still
achieve the primary objective—for organizations to use these
symbols to better serve their audiences with disabilities.
“Several existing symbols did not meet the standards we
established and needed redesign. For example, the old symbol
for Assistive Listening Systems focused on the disability (an
ear with a diagonal bar through it). The new symbol focuses on
the accommodation to the disability, i.e., a device that amplifies
sound for people who have difficulty hearing. Other upgraded
symbols include Sign Language Interpreted, Access (Other than
Print or Braille) for Individuals Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision,
and the International Symbol of Accessibility. A new symbol for
Audio Description for TV, Video and Film was developed which,
through design, proved less likely to degenerate when subjected
to frequent photocopying.”

  <summary>Icon Design</summary>

  Icons and icon systems are used for print, environmental graphics, or screen. They have become more ubiquitous due to the proliferation of screen media and their significant roles in websites, mobile apps and more. Across media, you have many of the same considerations:
- Who is the audience?
- At what size will the icons be seen?
- What is the context and where will the icons be seen—on screen, close-up, lighted, from a distance, in print? At which perspective or angle? What are the communication goals? What do the icons
- represent—actions, figures, places, objects, creatures?
- How reductive or elemental do they need to be to work? Totally no-frills?
- Are the icons part of a system?
- Which style will work across the system and is appropriate for the entire design project?

  #### Icon Design Tips
    - Accurately depict the shape of the object to allow users to recog-
    nize and decipher the icon at a glance.
    - Aim for elemental form. Economy of form trumps intricacy
    or complexity. Details and any excess information may
    confuse the user, especially on smaller screens.
    - Represent an image from its most characteristic angle.
    - Select commonly recognizable images that people around the
    world will be able to understand.
    - Select color and/or values for impact, legibility, meaning, brand
    storytelling, and context (for example, icons inside toolbar
    buttons are not in color).
    - Treat all icons in a system consistently in terms of style of
    visualization, perspective, and near and far. For example,
    as a general rule, if one icon is cropped, they should all be
    cropped. If one icon is seen in full view from straight on, all
    should be depicted similarly.
    - Use a consistent single light source on all icon objects, if using
    light and shadow to depict form.
    - Icons should work well on both white and black backgrounds.
    - Scale the icon for different sizes (1,024 3 1,024 pixels; 512 3 512 pixels; 256 3 256 pixels; 128 3 128 pixels; 32 3 32 pixels; 16 3 16 pixels).

When icons function as part of a larger design solution, such as a mobile app, a desktop application, a wayfinding program, or a website, their design is considered in relation to the broader context and project, ensuring they function as standalone solutions, achieving communication goals, and within the broader context.

Designing a system requires a clear design concept and a consistent use of scale, perspective, shapes, and formal elements, such as line, color, and texture. The signs or icons in a system must look as if they belong to the same family. At times, more than one designer in a design studio will work to produce a system. It is imperative to establish a firm design concept, style, and vocabulary of shapes for the system to look like it was created by one hand and mind, as in the complete set of fifty passenger and pedestrian symbols developed by the AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts).
