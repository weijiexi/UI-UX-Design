# The Design Process
<details>
  <summary>Phase 1: Orientation</summary>

  The process of becoming familiar with your assignment, the graphic design problem, and the client’s business or organization, product, service, or group. Usually, junior designers and junior art directors or copywriters are not involved in strategic planning or in design brief formation. ```Juniors are challenged by a simple design brief that has been distilled for them by their design director or art director.```
  - #### Before sketching, you need to gather and absorb a good deal of information. 
  - #### Material Gathering: Getting All the Information 

    To design, first you must learn about the sector, the product, service, company, or organization, the company’s history, core values and attributes, mission, and of course, the audience. 

    If your assignment is to design a logo for a farm tractor manufacturer, you need to learn about farm tractors, a farm tractor’s purpose and utility, who purchases and uses tractors, the marketplace for such equipment, as well as competing farm tractor brands. Unless you are an expert on farm tractors, you’d have to collect information. 

    Every designer must be informed about his or her sector under assignment, the client’s business, and the problem under assignment.

  - #### Gathering Information Through Listening

    During this first phase of the design process, you get the lay of the land and obtain as much raw materials as you can. In most cases, the client or individual (executive, editor, creative director, other) in charge of the project provides a good deal of information. This person is the expert about his or her brand or group. That certainly does not qualify the client (or account executive or editor) to design, but it does mean that you should listen carefully to the information this particular expert can offer—to what the client says about the problem, audience, and marketplace—and thoughtfully examine the information provided by the client.

  <summary>Phase 2: Analysis</summary>

  You are examining, assessing, discovering, and planning. You are not conceptualizing or designing during this phase of the design process. Examining all you have unearthed to best understand, assess, and strategize to move forward with the assignment. 
  - Strategy is the core tactical underpinning of any visual communication. It unifies all planning for all design and copy within a strategic program or campaign. Essentially, the strategy is how you are conceiving, creating, and positioning your brand or group and aiming your graphic design in the marketplace to achieve differentiation, relevance, and resonance. A clearly defined strategy directs all strategic and creative expressions, and keeps the client and creative professionals on the same page.
  - The Design Brief

    A design brief is a strategic plan that both the client and design firm or advertising agency agree upon, a written document outlining and strategizing a design project; it is also called a creative brief, brief, or creative work plan. (Strategy can be determined outside a design brief, as well.) Most important for designers and the creative team, strategy is a springboard for conceptual development.

    Most design briefs are made up of questions and answers—a format used in an attempt to fully understand the assignment, the objectives of the project, the design context, and the audience. The answers to questions delineated in a design brief are usually based on predesign (preliminary) market research and information gathered about the product, service or group, and audience. Answers are predicated on the budget. Finally, the design brief becomes the strategic plan for implementing objectives. It is a written standard against which creative solutions can be measured. The client and creative professionals can go back to the brief for guidance, or designers can use it to support their concepts and/or solutions. A thoughtful, clear brief can foster creative concept generation.

  <summary>Phase 3: Conception</summary>

  A foundational concept drives the design. A design concept is the creative reasoning underpinning a design. It is the guiding idea that determines how you design—how you create or why you select imagery and typefaces or lettering and the reasoning for color palette selection. The design concept sets the framework for all your design decisions. It is the primary broad abstract idea driving the hows and whys of your design decisions. 

  A design concept is visually expressed through the creation, selection, combination, manipulation, and arrangement of visual and type elements. 

  For many students and novices, generating concepts is the most challenging stage in the design process. It is not enough to simply arrange graphic elements into a pleasing form. ```It is necessary to expressively and clearly communicate an idea and/or message to an audience through the visual design. Formulating a concept necessitates analysis, interpretation, inference, and reflective thinking.```

  #### Concept-Generation Process
  The generally accepted protocol for graphic design conception is based on the four-stage model outlined in The Art of Thought by Graham Wallas, English political scientist and psychologist, in 1926:
   #### Preparation > Incubation > Illumination > Verification
- ##### Step 1: Preparation
    - A. Thoroughly examine your materials for insights.
    - B. Examine for connections among thoughts and/or facts. Then correlate to find an insight or idea platform.
    - C. Write any idea or insight on an index card, in a notebook, or in a digital file.
- ##### Step 2: Incubation Period

    Once you have examined all the materials, allow the information to incubate in your mind. Taking a break from working on an assignment turns the concept generation over to your subconscious mind. By allowing the problem to incubate in the back of your mind, your subconscious may do the job for you. Often, to take a break, designers turn to experiencing  other arts, which might engage their conscious minds, stimulate emotional responses, and encourage the subconscious.

    Examples include reading award-winning fiction; seeing an art house film; attending a music or dance concert, theater performance, or fine art exhibit; or creating fine art (painting, sculpting, drawing, photography, or ceramic arts). Some designers find semiconscious behaviors prompt a constructive response, behaviors such as doodling, daydreaming, or folding ing paper into odd shapes, or any kind of constructive selfentertainment. Psychologists say this is especially useful if the mind is turning over a problem.

- ##### Step 3: Illumination/CONCEPTION
    - Words: Legendary graphic designer and adman George Lois advises using words to generate concepts. Lois asserts visual artists can think equally well in words as in visuals. ```Try making word lists, word associations, word maps, word mergers, or any method that will work for you.```
    - Theme: A theme is a distinct conceptual or pictorial topicbased approach, which can be based on a thought, an emotion, society, nature, politics, religion, among other subject areas such as war and peace or democracy. Variations on a theme also can work as a platform for ideation.
     - Symbol: Employ an object or image to represent or stand for another thing, thought, idea, or feeling.
     - Literary and rhetorical devices: Use a metaphor, simile, onomatopoeia, personification, pleonasm, or metonymy.
     - Merge: Combine two related or unrelated objects or images together to form a unique new construction or relationship.
     - Synthesis: Combine/synthesize more than two separate elements that form a new, more complex whole.
    - Juxtaposition: Place two images side by side for contrast or comparison.

- ##### Step 4: Verific ation: Crystallizing the Design Concept

    Once you generate a concept, you need to evaluate it, testing for both functionality and creativity. Most concepts require refinement to strengthen them and to ensure they will work in practice. This is the point in the process to keenly critique your own concepts. Verification involves evaluating/assessing and logically supporting your viewpoint.

    Those who are able to generate concepts quickly or immediately are either seasoned designers or well informed about the subject and assignment. Experienced imaginative thinkers rely on creative thinking tools in their repertoire, just as a seasoned winning football coach relies on personal experience, a range of techniques, skills, and instincts.

    Several steps are involved in concept generation:
    - Defining the design problem
    - Preparing: gathering and examining materials
    - Incubating
    - Generating and selecting ideas
    - Assessing ideas

  <summary>Phase 4: Design</summary>

  Many designers create thumbnail sketches throughout the process to develop concepts, to visualize, and to compose. Some designers start with visual collages. Others start with words. 

- ##### Step 1: Thumbnail Sketches

  The actual process of sketching allows you to think visually, to explore and make discoveries, and to stay open to possibilities during the art-making process. At first, generating many sketches may be frustrating. It gets easier with experience. Generate as many different visual concepts as possible. 

  José Mollá, founder and creative director of La Comunidad in Miami, advises: “The difference between bad and good creatives is that they both come up with the same pedestrian solutions, but the bad creative stops there and the good creative keeps working toward a more unique and interesting solution.”

  Tip: When you show your thumbnail sketches to your instructor or design director, it’s helpful to number them for reference, especially if you are e-mailing them.
- ##### Step 2: Roughs

  Roughs are larger and more refined than thumbnail sketches. The purpose of this stage is to flesh out a few of your best ideas, to work on each design concept and how it can best be expressed through the creation, selection, and manipulation of type and visuals in a composition more fully, before going to a final stage. Even though a rough may look final, it is not finished at this point. 

  Roughs should be done to scale (in correct aspect ratio of the final format, whether it is a website, outdoor billboard, or business card).

  If a design concept does not work as a rough, it certainly will not work as a final solution. If it’s not working, rethink, go back over your thumbnail sketches, or generate more concepts. It is important to generate several workable design concepts at the outset so that you have backup. ```Most clients prefer to select from among at least three entirely different design concepts and executions, not variations on one concept.``` Depending on how you work, you will have begun or be in the midst of visualization.  Roughs are also used to explore possible creative approaches to image making—collage, photomontage, printmaking, drawing, or any handmade technique that can be used to best express your design concept.

  Tip: It is a good idea to wait a day or so between creating roughs and creating comps, which is the next step. Time in between will give you a fresh perspective on your work. That means you have to budget your time accordingly.
- ##### Step 3: Comprehensives
  A comprehensive, referred to as a comp, is a detailed representation of a design concept thoughtfully visualized and composed. Comps usually look like a printed or finished piece.

  Depending on your design director or creative director at work, he or she may wish to see each visual stage—from thumbnails through comps for input or approval. A client sees a well-crafted final comp.
