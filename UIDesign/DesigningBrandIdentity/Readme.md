# Designing Brand Identity

<details>
  <summary>Nine Design Elements Your Brand Absolutely, Positively Needs</summary>

### Logo | Identity
Whether this is a “wordmark” – simply the name of your brand or company in a specific font treatment, or a “lock-up” of a wordmark in combination with a icon that used as a unit.

### Alternate Logos
Possibly a version that works in a square format or one that works in a long horizontal format. ```A brand have up to 2 alternate layouts of their logo for specific usages.``` It is strongly advised not to go overboard here – you don’t want to confuse your customer. If your logo has one or more colors in it, it is also a good idea to have a version that is only black and white.

### Usage Guidelines | Yes/No Rules
You need to have a document created that is a set of instructions illustrating exactly how they are allowed to be used. Can your logo have a drop-shadow added to it? Will you allow people to stretch the logo out vertically? Should they be allowed to fill the letters with a photograph? No “not allowed” rule is too ridiculous to
show. You would be alarmed what people will do to your logo – to be “creative” or to “make it special for just this one use”.

### Fonts
Outline exactly what fonts and sizes are allowed to be used on your brand collateral materials, website, of products. There should be an absolute maximum of four. But ```I suggest you limit it to two fonts: a primary and secondary.``` A main usage font for titles and headlines and a secondary or text body copy font.

### Color Palette
Color is the strongest driver of primal emotional reaction. Don’t go overboard here. ```Four or five colors is all you need for 90% of brands.``` A main brand color, a couple neutral colors, a “pop” or bright color, and a
darker color. (Try Adobe’s Kuler.com, an amazing tool for generating complementary color palettes)

### Pattern +Texture
Having a pattern to use in backgrounds on websites, brochures, banner ads, will come in handy.

### Graphic Elements + Icons
```Designing or choosing a style of icon to be used with your branding materials is an often-overlooked part of brand design.``` The need for iconography has become even more necessary as brands operate more and more in the digital realm. When it comes down to it, people don’t want to read. They want cryptography. They want to be able to navigate with pictures. What will the style of your icons be? Cartoony? Technical? Hand illustrated?One color? The choices you make here will reflect on your brands personality.

### Photography
```Choosing a photographic style to become associated with your brand``` is an opportunity to elevate your brand beyond the competition. You don’t necessarily have to spend tons of money getting everything shot custom for you. But carefully selecting the style of photography and developing guidelines showing how to use them will make your brand stand out from the crowd. It can be as easy as how they are colored. Are they retro and faded? Bright and deeply saturated? Two-toned? Black and white? Is the style amateurish and spontaneous? Polished and posed? Action-packed? You get the idea.

### Usage Examples
Create examples of what your branding, logo, fonts, color, palette, etc. look like when they are actually used. This will give aesthetic guidance to your future design, marketing and advertising partners. Design a mock-up of a few items that illustrate how your brand could appear. Try a T-shirt, signage, a full-page magazine ad, a billboard, delivery truck, Facebook banner. It doesn’t matter whether you actually will be using all of these in real life. It creates a picture of your brand ecosystem. You will be surprised how designing just a few examples will begin to provide a clear idea of how your brand “looks and feels”.

    <summary>Brand basics</summary>

   #### What is brand?
   A strong brand stands out in a densely crowded marketplace. People fall in love with brands, trust them, and believe in their superiority.  
   
   #### What is brand identity?
   Brand identity is tangible and appeals to the senses. Brand identity fuels recognition, amplifies differentiation, and makes big ideas and meaning accessible. Brand identity takes disparate elements and unifies them into whole systems.

   #### What is branding?
   Branding is used to build awareness and extend customer loyalty. It requires a mandate from the top and readiness to invest in the future. Branding is about seizing every opportunity to express why people should choose one brand over another. A desire to lead, outpace the competition, and give employees the best tools to reach customers are the reasons why companies leverage branding.

   #### Who are stakeholders?
   Seizing every opportunity to build brand champions requires identifying the constituencies that affect success. Reputation and goodwill extend far beyond a brand’s target customers. Gaining insight into stakeholder characteristics, behavior, needs, and perceptions yields a high return.

   #### Why invest?
   The best identity programs embody and advance the company’s brand by supporting desired perceptions. Identity expresses itself in every touchpoint of the brand and becomes intrinsic to a company’s culture—a constant symbol of its core values and its heritage.

   #### Brand strategy
   Effective brand strategy provides a central, unifying idea around which all behavior, actions, and communications are aligned. It works across products and services, and is effective over time. The best brand strategies are so differentiated and powerful that they deflect the competition. They are easy to talk about, whether you are the CEO or an employee.

   #### Cross cultures
   The best brands pay attention to cultural differences.

   #### Big idea
   A big idea functions as an organizational totem pole around which strategy, behavior, actions, and communications are aligned. These simply worded statements are used internally as a beacon of a distinctive culture and externally as a competitive advantage that helps consumers make choices.

   #### Customer experience
   Consumers are inundated with choices. Brand builders need to think far beyond the point of sale, and use their strategic imagination and business acumen to deliver one-of-a-kind engaging experiences that no other competitor can replicate. 

   #### Brand architecture
   Brand architecture refers to the hierarchy of brands within a single company. It is the interrelationship of the parent company, subsidiary companies, products, and services, and should mirror the marketing strategy. It is important to bring consistency, visual and verbal order, thought, and intention to disparate elements to help a company grow and market more effectively. 

   ### Names
   The right name is timeless, tireless, easy to say and remember; it stands for something, and facilitates brand extensions. Its sound has rhythm. It looks great in the text of an email and in the logo. A wellchosen name is an essential brand asset, as well as a 24/7 workhorse. 

   ### Taglines
   A tagline is a short phrase that captures a company’s brand essence, personality, and positioning, and distinguishes the company from its competitors. Deceptively simple, taglines are not arbitrary. They grow out of an intensive strategic and creative process.

   #### Staying on message
   Stay on message is the brand mantra. The best brands speak with one distinctive voice. On the web, in a tweet, in conversations with a salesperson, in a speech given by the president, ```the company needs to project the same unified message. ```It must be memorable, identifiable, and centered on the customer.

   <summary>Brand ideals</summary>

   #### Brand ideals: Overview
   Ideals are essential to a responsible creative process regardless of the size of a company or the nature of a business. These ideals hold true whether the brand identity engagement is launching an entrepreneurial venture, creating a new product or service, repositioning a brand, working on a merger, or creating a retail presence.

   Functional criteria do not get to the heart of brand identity. There are over one million trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The basic question is what makes one better than another and why?

   What are the essential characteristics of the best identities? How do we define the best identities? These ideals are not about a certain aesthetic. Design excellence is a given.
