   <summary>Designing identity Elements</summary>
   
   ### Logo | Identity
   Whether this is a “wordmark” – simply the name of your brand or company in a specific font treatment, or a “lock-up” of a wordmark in combination with a icon that used as a unit.

   A logotype is a word (or words) in a determined font, which may be standard, modified, or entirely redrawn. Frequently, a logotype is juxtaposed with a symbol in a formal relationship called the signature. 

   Logotypes need durable and sustainable. ```Legibility at various scales and in a range of media is imperative, ```whether a logotype is silk-screened on the side of a ballpoint pen or illuminated in an external sign twenty stories off the ground.

   ```The best logotypes are a result of careful typographic exploration. Designers consider the attributes of each letterform, as well as the relationships between letterforms.``` In the best logotypes, letterforms may be redrawn, modified, and manipulated in order to express the appropriate personality and positioning of the company. The designer begins his or her process by examining hundreds of typographic variations. Beginning with the basics—for example, whether the name should be set in all caps or caps and lowercase—the designer proceeds to look at classic and modern typefaces, roman and italic variations, and various weights, scales, and combinations. The designer then proceeds to manipulate and customize the logotype. ```Each decision is driven by visual and performance considerations, as well as by what the typography itself communicates.```

   #### There are fundamental ways of depicting shapes or forms.
   - Elemental form: line or flat tone used to reduce an image or subject to stark simplicity, similar to a pictograph.
   - Linear: line used as the main element to depict or describe the shape or form. This can be as simple as a notation or as complex as a full-out linear rendering.(Brand Identity: Sony)
   - High contrast: depiction of forms based on extreme contrast of light and shadow falling on a three-dimensional form.
   - Volumetric: light and shadow, gradation, or modeling used to suggest the illusion of three-dimensional form.
   - Texture or pattern: line or marks used to suggest form, light,

    <summary>Gestalt principles are a powerful tool for logo design</summary>
  
  In fact, some of the most iconic logos in the world use Gestalt theory to create simplicity, cleverness, and memorability.

  Gestalt is a psychology theory that describes how people perceive visual elements as wholes rather than individual parts. In design, this helps you guide the viewer’s perception — so your logo communicates more with less.
    
  Gestalt makes your logo feel smart, efficient, and memorable. It allows you to suggest deep meaning without visual clutter — ideal for AI, digital, and abstract concepts.
  - Figure/Ground - Viewers see a shape by what is around it (positive/negative space)	FedEx logo — hidden arrow between E and x
  - Closure - The brain fills in missing shapes to create a whole	WWF panda logo — not all lines are complete
  - Similarity - Elements that look similar are grouped together	Olympic rings — unified by color and shape
  - Proximity - Items close together are perceived as one group	Cisco logo — vertical bars represent a bridge
  - Continuity - The eye follows smooth paths even across gaps	Unilever logo — multiple icons forming a U
  - Symmetry & Order - The mind prefers balanced, symmetrical design	Apple logo — perfectly shaped, complete form
   </details>

   ### Alternate Logos
   Possibly a version that works in a square format or one that works in a long horizontal format. ```A brand have up to 2 alternate layouts of their logo for specific usages.``` It is strongly advised not to go overboard here – you don’t want to confuse your customer. If your logo has one or more colors in it, it is also a good idea to have a version that is only black and white.

   #### Look and feel
   Look and feel is the visual language that makes a system proprietary and immediately recognizable. It also expresses a point of view. This support system of color, imagery, typography, and composition is what makes an entire program cohesive and differentiated. In the best programs, designers create an overall look that resonates in the mind of the customer and rises above the clutter of a visual environment. All elements of a visual language should be intentionally designed to advance the brand strategy, each doing its part and working together as a whole to unify and distinguish.

   ### Usage Guidelines | Yes/No Rules
   You need to have a document created that is a set of instructions illustrating exactly how they are allowed to be used. Can your logo have a drop-shadow added to it? Will you allow people to stretch the logo out vertically? Should they be allowed to fill the letters with a photograph? No “not allowed” rule is too ridiculous to show. You would be alarmed what people will do to your logo – to be “creative” or to “make it special for just this one use”.

   ### Typography | Fonts
   Outline exactly what fonts and sizes are allowed to be used on your brand collateral materials, website, of products. There should be an absolute maximum of four. But ```I suggest you limit it to two fonts: a primary and secondary.``` A main usage font for titles and headlines and a secondary or text body copy font.

   Typography is a core building block of an effective identity program. A unified and coherent company image is not possible without typogaraphy that has a unique personality and an inherent legibility. 

   Typography must support the positioning strategy and information hierarchy. Identity program typography needs to be susatainable and not on the curve of a fad.

   Choosing the right font requires a basic knowl edge of the breadth of options and a core understanding of how effective typography functions. Issues of functionality differ dramatically on a form, a pharmaceutical package, a magazine ad, and a website. The typeface needs to be flexible and easy to use, and it must provide a wide range of expression. ```Clarity and legibility are the drivers.```

   A typeface for a logo should be chosen for its form, appropriateness, and expressive potential, with knowledge of both the denotative meaning and the connotative meaning (heri-tage, voice, expressive meaning) of the typeface. When the budget allows, a proprietary typeface can be commissioned for the logo.

   #### Keep in mind these basic typographic considerations for logo and visual identity design:
   - Legibility
   - Connotation: appropriateness, voice, and expression
   - Uniqueness and distinction (consider a proprietary typeface)
   - Differentiation from competition
   - Select a typeface family for range, flexibility of use, weights, widths, including numerals and bullets
   - Limit the number of typefaces (no more than two is a good rule)
   - Works in a range of sizes and across all formats and media
   - Web fonts are built around web standards, tailored specifically for websites
   - Works well in black and white and color
   - Choose a typeface for the text of the correspondence on stationery to complement the logo, not replicate it

   ### Color Palette
   Color is the strongest driver of primal emotional reaction. Don’t go overboard here. ```Four or five colors is all you need for 90% of brands.``` A main brand color, a couple neutral colors, a “pop” or bright color, and a darker color. (Try Adobe’s Kuler.com, an amazing tool for generating complementary color palettes)

   Color brand identity basics While some colors are used to unify an identity, other colors may be used functionally to clarify brand architecture, through differentiating products or business lines. ```Traditionally the primary brand color is assigned to the symbol, and the secondary color is assigned to the logotype, business descriptor, or tagline. ``` Families of color are developed to support a broad range of communications needs. Ensuring optimum reproduction of the brand color is an integral element of standards, and part of the challenge of unifying colors across packaging, printing, signage, and electronic media.

   ```Color is used to evoke emotion and express personality. It stimulates brand association and accelerates differentiation.```  In the sequence of visual perception, the brain reads color after it registers a shape and before it reads content. Choosing a color for a new identity requires a core understanding of color theory, a clear vision of how the brand needs to be perceived and differentiated, and an ability to master consistency and meaning over a broad range of media. Use color to facilitate recognition and build brand equity. Colors have different connotations in different cultures. Research. Color is affected by various reproduction methods. Test.The designer is the ultimate arbiter for setting color consistency across platforms. Ensuring consistency across applications is frequently a challenge. Remember, most of the world uses a PC. Test. Sixty percent of the decision to buy a product is based on color. You can never know enough about color. Depend on your basic color theory knowledge: warm, cool; values, hues; tints, shades; complementary colors, contrasting colors. Quality insures that the brand identity asset is protected.
   
   Many brands are synonymous with the color or color palette
of their visual identities (think BP’s bright yellow and green
palette, Dunkin’ Donuts’s orange and pink, Coca-Cola’s red,
or IBM’s blue). 

   Color contributes to distinction and influences people’s brand perception. People are greatly affected by color, and cultural and psychological color associations influence them. 

   Color plays an important role, and it is specified by the
designer along with other visual identity guidelines. For the
San Francisco Zoo, Kit Hinrichs and his team created a color
palette of natural earthy and vibrant hues to aid in expressing
the design concept.

   #### Keep in mind these basic color considerations for logo and visual identity:
   - Choose color or color palette for distinction and differentiation from the competition. Like a construct, a brand should “own” a color in its category, for example, Coca-Cola owns red in the soft drink category.
   - Choose color wisely for meaning, connotations, and symbolism across cultures.
   - Use color to build meaning (as did Tiffany and BP).
   - Use color variations in logos of the same company or brand to represent different operating units or brand extensions.
   - Ensure color consistency across media.
   
   ### Pattern +Texture
   Having a pattern to use in backgrounds on websites, brochures, banner ads, will come in handy.

   ### Graphic Elements + Icons
   ```Designing or choosing a style of icon to be used with your branding materials is an often-overlooked part of brand design.``` The need for iconography has become even more necessary as brands operate more and more in the digital realm. When it comes down to it, people don’t want to read. They want cryptography. They want to be able to navigate with pictures. What will the style of your icons be? Cartoony? Technical? Hand illustrated?One color? The choices you make here will reflect on your brands personality.

   ### Animation
   The animated version of an identity is part of the initial concept. Motion must support the essence and meaning of an identity, not trivialize it.
   
   ### Photography
   ```Choosing a photographic style to become associated with your brand``` is an opportunity to elevate your brand beyond the competition. You don’t necessarily have to spend tons of money getting everything shot custom for you. But carefully selecting the style of photography and developing guidelines showing how to use them will make your brand stand out from the crowd. It can be as easy as how they are colored. Are they retro and faded? Bright and deeply saturated? Two-toned? Black and white? Is the style amateurish and spontaneous? Polished and posed? Action-packed? You get the idea.

   ### Usage Examples | Graphics Standards Manual
   Create examples of what your branding, logo, fonts, color, palette, etc. look like when they are actually used. This will give aesthetic guidance to your future design, marketing and advertising partners. Design a mock-up of a few items that illustrate how your brand could appear. Try a T-shirt, signage, a full-page magazine ad, a billboard, delivery truck, Facebook banner. It doesn’t matter whether you actually will be using all of these in real life. It creates a picture of your brand ecosystem. You will be surprised how designing just a few examples will begin to provide a clear idea of how your brand “looks and feels”.

    <summary>Brand basics</summary>

   #### What is brand?
   A strong brand stands out in a densely crowded marketplace. People fall in love with brands, trust them, and believe in their superiority.  
   
   #### What is brand identity?
   Brand identity is tangible and appeals to the senses. Brand identity fuels recognition, amplifies differentiation, and makes big ideas and meaning accessible. Brand identity takes disparate elements and unifies them into whole systems.

   #### What is branding?
   Branding is used to build awareness and extend customer loyalty. It requires a mandate from the top and readiness to invest in the future. Branding is about seizing every opportunity to express why people should choose one brand over another. A desire to lead, outpace the competition, and give employees the best tools to reach customers are the reasons why companies leverage branding.

   #### Who are stakeholders?
   Seizing every opportunity to build brand champions requires identifying the constituencies that affect success. Reputation and goodwill extend far beyond a brand’s target customers. Gaining insight into stakeholder characteristics, behavior, needs, and perceptions yields a high return.

   #### Why invest?
   The best identity programs embody and advance the company’s brand by supporting desired perceptions. Identity expresses itself in every touchpoint of the brand and becomes intrinsic to a company’s culture—a constant symbol of its core values and its heritage.

   #### Brand strategy
   Effective brand strategy provides a central, unifying idea around which all behavior, actions, and communications are aligned. It works across products and services, and is effective over time. The best brand strategies are so differentiated and powerful that they deflect the competition. They are easy to talk about, whether you are the CEO or an employee.

   #### Cross cultures
   The best brands pay attention to cultural differences.

   #### Big idea
   A big idea functions as an organizational totem pole around which strategy, behavior, actions, and communications are aligned. These simply worded statements are used internally as a beacon of a distinctive culture and externally as a competitive advantage that helps consumers make choices.

   #### Customer experience
   Consumers are inundated with choices. Brand builders need to think far beyond the point of sale, and use their strategic imagination and business acumen to deliver one-of-a-kind engaging experiences that no other competitor can replicate. 

   #### Brand architecture
   Brand architecture refers to the hierarchy of brands within a single company. It is the interrelationship of the parent company, subsidiary companies, products, and services, and should mirror the marketing strategy. It is important to bring consistency, visual and verbal order, thought, and intention to disparate elements to help a company grow and market more effectively. 

   ### Names
   The right name is timeless, tireless, easy to say and remember; it stands for something, and facilitates brand extensions. Its sound has rhythm. It looks great in the text of an email and in the logo. A wellchosen name is an essential brand asset, as well as a 24/7 workhorse. 

   ### Taglines
   A tagline is a short phrase that captures a company’s brand essence, personality, and positioning, and distinguishes the company from its competitors. Deceptively simple, taglines are not arbitrary. They grow out of an intensive strategic and creative process.

   #### Staying on message
   Stay on message is the brand mantra. The best brands speak with one distinctive voice. On the web, in a tweet, in conversations with a salesperson, in a speech given by the president, ```the company needs to project the same unified message. ```It must be memorable, identifiable, and centered on the customer.

   <summary>Brand ideals</summary>

   #### Brand ideals: Overview
   Ideals are essential to a responsible creative process regardless of the size of a company or the nature of a business. These ideals hold true whether the brand identity engagement is launching an entrepreneurial venture, creating a new product or service, repositioning a brand, working on a merger, or creating a retail presence.

   Functional criteria do not get to the heart of brand identity. There are over one million trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The basic question is what makes one better than another and why?

   What are the essential characteristics of the best identities? How do we define the best identities? These ideals are not about a certain aesthetic. Design excellence is a given.

   #### Vision
   Vision requires courage. Big ideas, enterprises, products, and services are sustained by organizations who have the ability to imagine what others cannot see and the tenacity to deliver what they believe is possible. Behind every successful brand are passionate leaders who inspire others to see the future in a new way.

   #### Meaning
   The best brands stand for something: a big idea, a strategic position, a defined set of values, a voice that stands apart. Symbols are vessels for meaning. They become more powerful with frequent use and when people understand what they stand for. They are the fastest form of communication known to man. Meaning is rarely immediate and evolves over time.

   #### Authenticity
   In psychology, authenticity refers to self-knowledge and making decisions that are congruent with that self-knowledge. Organizations who know who they are, and what they stand for, start the identity process from a position of strength. They create brands that are sustainable and genuine. Brand expression must be appropriate to the organization’s unique mission, history, culture, values, and personality.

   #### Coherence
   Whether a customer is using a product, talking to a service representative, or making a purchase on his iPhone, the brand should feel familiar and the experience should have the desired effect. Coherence is the quality that ensures that all the pieces hold together in a way that feels seamless to the customer. It doesn’t need to be rigid and limiting—rather, it is a baseline designed to build trust, foster loyalty, and delight the customer.

   #### Flexibility
   Innovation requires brands to be flexible. No one can say with certainty which new products or services a company might offer in five years. Or for that matter, what devices we will all be using to communicate with one another and how we will be purchasing our worldly goods. Brands that are open to change need to have flexible brand identity systems in place to quickly seize new opportunities in the marketplace.

   #### Commitment
   A brand is an asset that needs to be protected, preserved, and nurtured. Actively managing the asset requires a top down mandate and a bottom up understanding of why it’s important. The best companies provide their employees with tools that make it easy to be a brand champion. Building, protecting, and enhancing the brand requires desire and a disciplined approach to insure its integrity and relevance.

   #### Value
   Creating value is the indisputable goal of most organizations. The quest for sustainability has expanded the value conversation with consumers. Being socially responsible, environmentally conscious, and profitable is the new business model for all brands. A brand is an intangible asset—brand identity, which includes all tangible expression from packaging to websites, upholds that value. 

   #### Differentiation
   Bumper-to-bumper brands clamor for our attention. The world is a noisy place filled with a panoply of choice. Why should consumers choose one brand over others? It is not enough to be different. Brands need to demonstrate their difference and make it easy for customers to understand that difference.

   #### Sustainability
   Brands are messengers of trust. We are all moving at blinding speed and our institutions, technology, science, lifestyles, and vocabulary are in a state of continuous flux. Consumers are reassured by trademarks that are recognizable and familiar. Durability is achieved through a commitment to the equity of a central idea over time, and the capacity to transcend change.

   <summary>Brand elements</summary>

   ### Brandmarks
   Designed with an almost infinite variety of shapes and personalities, brandmarks can be assigned to a number of general categories. From literal through symbolic, from word-driven to image-driven, the world of brandmarks expands each day. 

   ### Sequence of cognition
   Brand awareness and recognition are facilitated by a visual identity that is easy to remember and immediately recognizable. Visual identity triggers perceptions and unlocks associations of the brand. Sight, more than any other sense, provides information about the world. 

   ### Wordmarks
   A wordmark is a freestanding word or words. It may be a company name or an acronym. ```The best wordmarks imbue a legible word or words with distinctive font characteristics, and may integrate abstract elements or pictorial elements. ```The distinctive tilted “E” in “Dell” activates and strengthens the one-syllable name. The IBM acronym has transcended enormous technological change in its industry

   ### Letterform marks
   The single letter is frequently used by designers as a distinctive graphic focal point for a brandmark. The letter is always a unique and proprietary design that is infused with significant personality and meaning. The letterform acts as a mnemonic device, and is easy to apply to an app icon.

   ### Pictorial marks
   A pictorial mark uses a literal and recognizable image. The image itself may allude to the name of the company or its mission, or it may be symbolic of a brand attribute. ```The simpler the form, the more difficult it is to draw. The most skillful designers know how to translate and simplify, play with light and shadow, and balance positive and negative space.```

   ### Abstract marks
   ```An abstract mark uses visual form to convey a big idea or a brand attribute. ```These marks, by their nature, can provide strategic ambiguity, and work effectively for large companies with numerous and unrelated divisions. Marks such as Chase’s have survived a series of mergers easily. ```Abstract marks are especially effective for service-based and technology companies; ``````however, they are extremely difficult to design well.```

   #### Emblems
   ```Emblems are trademarks featuring a shape inextricably connected to the name of the organization.``` The elements are never isolated. Emblems look terrific on a package, as a sign, or as an embroidered patch on a uniform. As mobile devices continue to shrink and multi-branding ads with onesixth-inch logos increase, the emblem presents the biggest legibility challenge when miniaturized.

   ### Dynamic marks
   Creativity always finds a way to challenge convention. Historically brand equity has been achieved in part by the frequency and global reach of a single icon, like Apple’s trademark or Nike’s swoosh. As life becomes more complex and more digital, designers have found new ways to express big ideas. This method is dependent on the craft of the designer, as in IBM’s Smarter Planet icons and Google Doodles. Engineers are beginning to partner with creative teams to program the future.

   ### Characters
   It’s alive! A character trademark embodies brand attributes or values. Characters quickly become the stars of advertising campaigns, and the best ones become cultural icons cherished by children and customers alike. Along with their distinctive appearance and personality, many characters have recognizable voices and jingles, enabling them to leap offthe silent shelf space onto your desktop.

   <summary>Brand dynamics</summary>

   #### Making a difference
   Making a difference has become essential to building a brand. Consumers are shopping their values, and businesses are rethinking their value propositions. The triple bottom line—people, planet, profit—is a new business model that represents a fundamental shift in how businesses measure success. 

   #### Social media
   Social media has become the fastest-growing budget in the marketing arsenal. While there is still much debate about how to measure and manage the ROI on social, one thing is clear: consumers have become active participants in the brand-building process. Retweets work at speeds much faster than the rollout of a global marketing campaign. Everyone has become a player, producer, director, and distributor.

   #### Mobile
   As smartphones and tablets get smarter, more interactive, and more intuitive, desks are being left behind. Devices are our shopping malls, miniuniversities, and spas for our minds. Siri eagerly waits to serve us, while armies of algorithms watch our every move.

   #### Apps 
   These small bits of affordable software have wide ranges of functionality and interactivity. The average smartphone user has 23 apps on her device. Whether you have an iPhone, Droid, or iPad, there are hundreds of thousands of choices.

   #### China
   As brand builders rush into the emerging BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), they most covet China, which represents the largest consumer market in the world and a dynamic economy. However, from a branding perspective, ```China is the most complex by far. Its vast diversity of regional, linguistic, and cultural nuances and its relative newness to branding demand extensive research, native advisors, and local partners.```

  <summary>Process</summary>

  <details>
   <summary>Process basics</summary>

   #### A process for success
   The brand identity process demands a combination of investigation, strategic thinking, design excellence, and project management skills. It requires an extraordinary amount of patience, an obsession with getting it right, and an ability to synthesize vast amounts of information.

   #### Managing the process
   Pay as much attention to the process as to the content. Michael Hirschhorn Organizational Dynamics Expert Astute project management is critical to achieving the long-term goals of a brand identity project. Responsible project management is the foundation for mutual respect, confidence, and long-term success. The identity process demands a range of skills on both the client side and the identity firm side. It demands leadership and creativity working hand in hand with planning, coordinating, analyzing, understanding, and managing time, resources, and money. In addition to organization and discipline, the process requires patience, enthusiasm, and a laser-like focus on achieving the end goal.

   #### Measuring success
   Brand identity systems are a long-term investment of time, human resources, and capital. Each positive experience with a brand helps build its brand equity and increases the likelihood of repeat purchasing and lifelong customer relationships. A return on investment is achieved, in part, through making it easier and more appealing for the customer to buy, making it easier for the sales force to sell, and being vigilant about the customer experience. Clarity about the brand, a clear process, and smart tools for employees fuel success.

   Decision makers frequently ask, “Why should we make this investment? Can you prove to me that it has a return?” It’s difficult to isolate the impact of a new logo, a better brand architecture, or an integrated marketing communications system. It is critical that companies develop their own measures of success. Those who don’t expect instant results, and think in the cumulative long term, understand the value of incremental change and focus.

   #### Collaboration
   Great outcomes require vision, commitment, and collaboration. Collaboration is not consensus or compromise. It evolves from a thoughtful and genuine focus on problem solving, generating an interdependent, connected approach. It also acknowledges the tension between different viewpoints and different disciplines. Most brand identity projects involve individuals from various departments with different agendas. Even small organizations have silos that stand in the way of achievement. Collaboration requires the ability to suspend judgment, listen carefully, and transcend politics. 

   ```Open source is a new model of collaboration, creativity, and problem solving, now used in product development and brand innovation. It is characterized by open sharing of information for mutual benefit between customers and merchants, creators and end users, employees and volunteers, and competitors. Wikipedia and Linux are the most well-known examples of the open source methodology.```

   #### Decision making
   Decision making requires trusting yourself, your process, and your team. Dr. Barbara Riley Managing Partner, Chambers Group LLC Decision making needs to be an intelligent, engaging process that builds trust and helps organizations make the right choices to build their brands. Most people can recall a scenario in which the wrong decision was made because of either politics or too many decision makers. Experts in the social sciences believe that decisions made by large groups tend to be more conservative and less inspired than decisions made by small groups. Yet organizational development experts may tell you that decision by consensus has the potential to result in higherquality decisions because the organization uses the resources of its members.

   #### Intellectual property
   Intellectual property rights sustain differentiation and protect valuable brand assets. Joshua L. Cohen RatnerPrestia Brands outperform their rivals by establishing a difference that they can express, sustain, and legally protect. The most successful brands stand out prominently in the marketplace in many ways. They can employ—alone or in combination—creative product and packaging designs, improved functionality, and source-identifying symbols like trademarks, logos, names, colors, and even vocal sounds. Consider Levi Strauss’s distinctive jean pocket stitching, Intel’s sonic logo, Tiffany’s robin’s-egg-blue packaging, and Coca-Cola’s iconic bottle design. Whether a distinctive feature appeals to a consumer’s practical needs, or satisfies pure desire, it has long-term value. Intellectual property refers to an intangible asset that is the result of creativity and includes patents, trademarks, or copyrights. Laws governing intellectual property advance various policies.

   ### Design management
   In-house design studios are the future of successful branding because you and the client are one. 

   Julia Hoffmann Creative Director, Advertising and Graphic Design, The Museum of Modern Art An in-house studio becomes indispensable to a brand when knowledge, investment, and pride fuse with vision, creativity, and a mastery of expression.

   Jeffrey Fields Vice President, Global Creative Studio Starbucks Internal creative teams need to seize their insider advantage by using deepknowledge of the brand to leverage their strategic value to the corporation.

   Moira Cullen Senior Director, Global Design The Hershey Company Getting a large, diverse group of people to agree on a single new global identity means the designer has to be a strategist, psychiatrist, diplomat, showman, and even a Svengali.

   Paula Scher Partner Pentagram Increasingly, experienced design directors are joining senior management teams to oversee and build the brand, manage the design group, and identify specialists needed. 

   ```Companies that value design as a core competency tend to bemore successful in their marketing and communications. ```Brand identity programs are usually developed by outside firms who have the right qualifications, experience, time, and staffing. The biggest mistake that external consulting firms and companies make is not including the internal design group in the initial research phase. The internal group has insight into the challenge of making things happen. In addition, successful implementation of the program is dependent on the internal group embracing and implementing the system. The best companies have a rollout program to ensure that all stakeholders across the company understand the parameters and rationale for the new brand identity. The internal team must have ongoing access to the external firm for questions, clarifications, and unforeseen circumstances. The external firm should come in for periodic reviews of new work, as well as participate in annual brand audits to ensure that brand expression remains fresh and relevant to the customer and prospect.

   <summary>Phase 1 Conducting research</summary>

   #### Conducting research: Phase 1 overview
   Brand identity requires business acumen and design thinking. The first priority is to understand the organization: its mission, vision, target markets, corporate culture, competitive advantage, strengths and weaknesses, marketing strategies, and challenges for the future. 

   Answering questions is relatively easy. Asking the right question is more difficult.

   ### Insight
   - ```Designing an identity is a dance between the intuitive and intentional.``` 
   - The greatest challenge of the brand identity process is to realize that you cannot control anything other than your focus and attention. 
   - Trusting the process and keeping the ball in the air will always deliver extraordinary outcomes. 
   - Although research is the business discipline for gathering and interpreting data, ```insight comes from a more personal and intuitive place.```

   #### Market research
   Market research is the gathering, evaluation, and interpretation of data affecting customer preferences for products, services, and brands. New insights about attitudes, awareness, and behavior of prospects and customers often indicate opportunities for future growth. Usability research has finally become more mainstream. 

   #### Usability testing 
   Usability testing is a research tool used by designers, engineers, and marketing teams to develop and refine new and existing products. This method can be extended to any part of the customer experience, purchasing, delivery, and customer service. Unlike other research methods, usability testing relies on “live” customer experiences with a product. Through the careful observation of a handful of typical users, product development teams can acquire immediate feedback on the product’s strengths and weaknesses. By documenting the actual experiences of people using the product, the development team can isolate and remedy any design flaws before releasing it to the market. The benefit of this approach is that it makes the end user’s needs central to the product development process, rather than an afterthought. 

   #### Marketing audit
   Marketing audits are used to methodically examine and analyze all marketing, communications, and identity systems, both existing systems and those out of circulation. To develop a vision for an organization’s brand in the future, you must have a sense of its history. Inevitably, something of worth has been tossed out over time—a tagline, a symbol, a phrase, a point of view—for what seemed to be a good reason at the time. There might be something from the past that should be resuscitated or repurposed. Perhaps a color or a tagline has been in place since the founding of the company. Consider whether this equity should be moved forward. 
   #### Competitive audit 
   Competitive audit examines the competition’s brands, key messages, and identity in the marketplace, from brandmarks and taglines to ads and websites. 

   #### language audit
   Language audit is an intrinsic part of the marketing audit, many companies do not tackle “voice” until after they have designed a new brand identity program. The courageous look at content and design at the same time, revealing the entire spectrum of how language is used. Analyzing the intersection of customer experience, design, and content is an intensive and rigorous endeavor that demands the left brain and right brain to work in tandem.

   <summary>Phase 2 Clarifying strategy</summary>

   Phase 2 involves both methodical examination and strategic imagination. It is about analysis, discovery, synthesis, simplicity, and clarity. This combination of rational thinking and creative intelligence characterizes the best strategies, which go where others have not.

   #### Narrowing the focus
   It is never enough to examine a company’s current business strategy, core values, target markets, competitors, distribution channels, technology, and competitive advantage. It is crucial to stand back and look at the big picture—what are the economic, sociopolitical, global, or social trends that will affect the brand in the future? What are the drivers that have made the company successful in the past? 

   #### Positioning
   Positioning is a process to identify what boldly differentiates a brand in the mind of a customer. Customers are overwhelmed with choices. Positioning has the potential to create new openings in an oversaturated, continually changing marketplace. The best positioning builds on a deep understanding of customer needs and aspirations, the competition, the strengths and weaknesses of a brand, changes in demographics, technology, and trends.

   #### Brand brief
   Documenting fundamental precepts of the brand is the most important task of Phase 2. What seems to most like a blinding flash of the obvious is frequently not. Robust discussions are facilitated by a simple, clear one-page diagram, as opposed to a twenty-page treatise that no one has read or remembers. Getting key decision makers to agree begins the creative process on a solid, shared understanding of the brand. The second objective is to write the creative brief, which is a road map for the creative team. Never write it until the brand brief is approved.

   #### Naming
   Naming is a complex, creative, and iterative process requiring experience in linguistics, marketing, research, and trademark law. Even for the experts, finding a name for today’s company, product, or service that can be legally protected presents a formid able challenge.

   Names need to be judged against positioning goals, performance criteria, and availability within a sector. It is natural to want to fall in love with a name, but the bottom line is that meaning and associations are built over time. Agreement is not easy to achieve, especially when choices seem limited. Contextual testing is smart and helps decision making.

   ### Phase 3 Designing identity

   The creative design process begins in Phase 3. ```Design is an iterative process that seeks to integrate meaning with form.```  The best designers work at the intersection of strategic imagination, intuition, design excellence, and experience.

   ### Website
   Websites lead the top of the brand necessity list—no longer enslaved to the desktop, they migrate to wherever the consumer is, on her iPad or her smartphone, to the mall, on a hike, or under her pillow. Websites have made every business a global business accessible by almost anyone anywhere. Engaging content and inviting interfaces have the potential to bring a brand to life. 

   Websites just may be the next best thing to reality, and in some cases they are more efficient, more user friendly, and faster. Think retail. ```The best websites know who their visitors are, and give them a reason to come back again and again.``` Videos have started to populate most websites with storytelling and testimonials. A number of specialists work collaboratively to build a site, including graphic and user experience designers, information architects, developers, content authors, project managers, and usability engineers. Search engine experts have become a critical part of the team in order to get high rankings in search engines.

   ### Favicons
   Favicons are miniaturized storefront signs that give brands an opportunity to attract attention and stand out from the crowd. ```They are the 16x16 pixel icons located in a web browser’s address bar. ```If companies don’t have a favicon, the browser’s generic default icon will be next to the URL. Favicons are also visible next to web page’s name in a web user’s list of bookmarks. Favicons need to work within the extreme size constraints of the web address bar. One would think that telegraphing a unique identity in such a small, low-res space would be impossible. It’s not. The simplest, boldest forms are immediately recognizable. Amazing.

   ### Correspondence
   Letterhead, offset-printed on fine paper, remains a core application in the brand identity system along with electronic letterheads. Letterhead with an original signature is still an important conduit for doing business. It is regarded as credible proof of being in business, and it frequently carries an important message or contractual agreement. It is still regarded as the most formal type of business communication and has an implicit dignity. For many years banks required businesses to write a letter on their letterhead in order to open an account. Most of the world uses letterhead and envelopes based on the metric system. Only the United States, Canada, and Mexico don’t.
  
   ### Business card
   The designer is faced with so much information to include—from emailto voicemail to mobile phone and 800 numbers, double addresses and domains—that the small business card is a challenge even for the most experienced designers. Information, by necessity, is flowing to the back side.

   The business card is a small and portable marketing tool. The quality and intelligence of the information are a reflection of the cardholderand her company. In the future a high-tech business card may double as an identification card and include a user’s fingerprint or other biometric data.
  
   ### Collateral
   You are waiting for your café latte and see a set of brochures in a stylish rack. You go to the doctor, and each aspect of your health care has its own publication. You’re in charge of making a buying decision at your office and your sales representative has a collection of information outlining his company’s history, case studies, and advantages for selecting his product over a competitor.

   ```The best collateral communicates the right information at the right time with a customer:``` discussing roasting techniques while you’re drinking that café latte; outlining surgery preparation before the big day; or making you feel more confident about that big purchase. 
  
   ### Signage
   Signage functions as identification, information, and advertising. Effective retail signage increases revenues, and intelligent wayfinding systems support and enhance the experience of a destination.

   Cities and towns around the world routinely revise sign codes in order to create environments that support the image that a community wants to portray, and to regulate standards to protect public safety.

   <summary>Phase 5 Managing assets</summary>

   ### Changing brand identity
   Rare is the person in an organization who
embraces change. Introducing a new name and
identity to an existing organization or to merged
entities is exponentially more difficult than creating a brand for a new company. Changing brand identity means that whatever was on a
manager’s plate now doubles. The to-do list is
extremely long, even in a small company. New
brand identity implementation requires a vigilant
strategic focus, advance planning, and obsession with detail.
Military mobilization skills come in handy,
and boundless optimism helps. Typically, the
director of marketing and public relations will
oversee the change. In larger organizations an
individual may be retained to focus exclusively
on implementation. The skills required are
knowledge of branding, public relations, communications, identity design, production, and organizational management. 
  
   ### Launching brand identity
   Get ready. Get set. Launch. A launch represents
a huge marketing opportunity. Smart organizations seize this chance to build brand awareness and synergy.
Different circumstances demand different launch
strategies—from multimedia campaigns,
company-wide meetings, and road tours, to a
T-shirt for each employee. Some organizations
execute massive visible change, including
external signage and vehicles, virtually overnight,
while others choose a phased approach.
Small organizations may not have the budget
for a multimedia campaign, but can leverage
social networks, like Facebook and Twitter.
Smart organizations create a sales call
opportunity to present a new card, or send a
blast email to each customer, colleague, and
vendor. Others use existing marketing channels,
such as inserting brochures with monthly
statements.
In nearly every launch, the most important audience is a company’s employees. Regardless of the scope and budget, a launch requires a comprehensive communications plan. Rarely is the
best launch strategy no strategy, which is the business-as-usual or un-launch. Occasionally an organization may not want to draw attention from the financial community or its shareholders, so it
may choose to do nothing.

   ### Building brand champions
   Engaging employees in the meaning of the
brand and the thinking behind it is one of the
best investments that a company can make.
Organizational development consultants have
long known that long-term success is directly
influenced by the way employees share in their
company’s culture—its values, stories, symbols,
and heroes. Traditionally the CEO and the marketing department were the most visible brand
champions—individuals who understood and
could articulate a company’s core values, vision,
and brand essence.
Companies all around the world are beginning
to develop compelling ways of sharing the brand
essence—from road shows, to online branding
tools and guides, to special events. What was
once a standards and guidelines toolkit for creative firms has evolved into a brand-building tool for all employees.

   ### Brand books
   Brand books, spirit books, and thought books
inspire, educate, and build brand awareness.
Brand strategy can’t influence anyone if it stays
in a conference room, in someone’s head, or on
page 3 of a marketing plan. The vision of a company and the meaning of a brand need a
communications vehicle that is accessible, portable, and personal. Online brand sites are more
frequently publishing “Who we are” and “What
our brand stands for,” in addition to standards,
templates, and guidelines.
Timing is everything. Companies in the midst of
organizational change need to convey “where
the ship is going.” Frequently, the brand identity
process sparks a new clarity about the brand.
Building awareness about how each employee
can help build the brand is smart. 

   ### Standards content | Graphics Standards Manual
   Designing, specifying, ordering, and printing or
fabricating elements of a new brand identity
system are all dependent on a set of intelligent
standards and guidelines. Good, solid standards
save time, money, and frustration. The size and
nature of an organization affect the depth and
breadth of the content and how marketing materials are conceived and produced in the future.
Usually printing and fabrication specifications
accompany design specifications. Legal and
nomenclature guideline considerations are
essential. Some guidelines include order forms
for business cards and other applications.
Following is an in-depth composite that can be
used as a reference for building an outline.

   ### Online branding tools
   The web has transformed brand management,
consolidating brand assets and establishing
24/7 access to user-friendly guidelines, tools,
and templates. Scalable, modular sites are
always current, evolving as a company grows.
Many sites feature brand vision and attributes,
helping to build a shared vocabulary. Robust
sites support strategic marketing, consistent
communications, and quality execution. Initially
envisioned to house logos and image libraries,
sites now encompass brand strategy, content
development guidelines, and web resources.
Creative firms and external vendors are assigned
passwords to access key messages, logos,
image libraries, glossaries, intellectual property
compliance, and a panoply of smart resources
and content. Sites may also be used for online
ordering and transactions. Access to certain sections may be limited to user groups. The success
of online branding tools is easily monitored
through usage statistics. Additionally site monitoring tools are now validating the significant
ROI results often realized using these tools.

   ### Reproduction files
   Maintaining the quality of reproduction in a
world where tools are continually changing is an
ongoing challenge. Users have urgent needs,
different levels of proficiency, various software
platforms, and a disparate understanding of
digital files, color, and quality. An asset management system needs to be diligent about naming,
organization, storage, retrieval, and overall
usability of file formats.
The designer’s responsibilities are to test all files
in numerous formats and to develop a retrievable
system that is logical and sustainable. The manager’s responsibility is to determine who has
access to files and how best to field all requests.
It is no longer unusual to download logo files and
images from a website’s media portal. Clear legal
guidelines, forms, and contact information help
protect the assets.
