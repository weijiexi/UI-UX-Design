    <summary>Core Foundations of Graphic Design</summary>

    - #### Layout & Grid Systems
      - Organizes space
      - Creates rhythm, flow, and balance
      - Forms the foundation of Swiss Design, branding, and editorial work
      - Think: Josef Müller-Brockmann, TRÜF, UI layout systems

    - #### Typography
      - Communicates tone and clarity
      - Type is not just text — it’s shape, texture, rhythm
      - Good design reads well and feels intentional
      - Think: Helvetica (Swiss Modernism), expressive hand lettering (Annik Troxler)
    - #### Hierarchy
      - Guides the viewer through the design
      - Establishes visual order: what to read first, second, etc.
      - Achieved through scale, weight, spacing, color, and contrast
      - Crucial for posters, UI, print layouts, and branding
    - #### Contrast
      - Difference in size, color, shape, type, or direction
      - Creates tension and focus
      - Helps highlight key information and give a visual voice
      - Example: Bold black text on a white background; soft curves vs. sharp edges
    - #### Balance (Symmetry/Asymmetry)
      - Ensures visual stability or deliberate disruption
      - Can be classical (symmetrical) or modern/dynamic (asymmetrical)
      - Think: Constructivist diagonals vs. centered book covers
    - #### Color Theory
      - Affects emotion, clarity, hierarchy, and brand meaning
      - Includes: hue, saturation, temperature, and value
      - Strategic use of limited palettes or vibrant abstraction = high impact
      - Example: TRÜF’s restrained B/W with one neon accent
    - #### Form & Shape Language
      - Geometry (circle, square, triangle) creates mood and concept
      - Organic shapes feel fluid or emotional; geometric ones feel rational and bold
      - Perfect for your interest in minimal + lyrical abstraction
    - #### Negative Space
      - “The space between” — gives design breathing room
      - Can be used as a clever compositional element (FedEx arrow, yin-yang, etc.)
      - Also creates visual poetry and clarity
    - #### Concept / Idea-Driven Design
      - Beyond visuals, design must communicate a core idea
      - Visual metaphors, symbols, and structure should support meaning
      - Think: TRÜF’s animals as abstract geometry with clever meaning
    - #### Consistency / System Thinking
      - Especially important in branding, UI/UX, identity systems
      - Consistent use of type, grid, color, and spacing builds trust
      - Key to logo systems like NASA, IBM, 4G LTE/FPGA/EDGE AI
    - #### Bonus: Emotional & Expressive Foundations
      - Improvisation - Adds unpredictability, rhythm, and human feeling
      - Lyrical abstraction - Turns emotion into form — visual poetry
      - Artistic intuition - Balances logic with sensitivity, especially in poster or motion work
    ### Summary Table
    - Grid / Layout: Conceptual clarity
    - Typography: Visual storytelling
    - Color: Hierarchy & flow
    - Form / Shape: Communication & emotion
    - Contrast & Balance: Brand consistency
